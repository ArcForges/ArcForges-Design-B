# Deployment and Release Execution

[P2-012](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-012) current implementation authorities: [D1 migration, capacity and independent recovery](data-model/04-d1-execution-profile.md).

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Architecture
> Governing authority: `§6` and `§6.1` of the cloud requirements, `§15` of the quality contract, `§11` of the build architecture
> Companions: [`14-build-packaging-and-release.md`](14-build-packaging-and-release.md), [`05-cloud-architecture.md`](05-cloud-architecture.md), [`20-cross-system-lifecycles.md`](20-cross-system-lifecycles.md)

The requirements say migration is a gated step, that schema change uses expand/contract, and that a production deployment is reversible. **What none of them gives is the sequence** — the order of the phases, the check that must pass between each, and what happens when one fails with a half-deployed fleet. A deployment procedure that exists only as a set of rules is a procedure that gets improvised at 2 a.m.

### Web deployment boundary

[P2-009](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) deploys independent immutable artifacts. Browser /api and /session routes target C# Cloud; /objects targets the authorized Worker handler; AI control/output uses /api. Preserve validated external Origin; never send native credential-issuance methods through browser RPC allowlists. RPC retains protobuf frames/trailers, HTTP exceptions retain their declared body, and neither enters SPA fallback. Auth/session/config/API responses use no-store, hashed public assets immutable caching. Restore invalidates session/CSRF state; no Data Protection key ring or production Node process is required.

## 1. Controlling rules

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-dx-01"></a>DX-01 | **A deployment is a sequence of phases, each with an entry check, an exit check and a defined failure action.** A phase without all three is not deployable. |
| <a id="rule-dx-02"></a>DX-02 | **Every phase is independently reversible, or it is not entered.** Where reversal is impossible — a contract phase that drops a column — the phase is deferred until the version that needs it is irreversibly established (`§2.4`). |
| <a id="rule-dx-03"></a>DX-03 | **No phase depends on every replica being at the same version at the same instant.** Rolling deployment means mixed versions are the normal state, not an exception ([PS-10](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-ps-10) of the cloud architecture). |
| <a id="rule-dx-04"></a>DX-04 | **Production never rebuilds** ([EN-10](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-10)). The digest built once in CI is what runs, and deployment references the digest, never a tag ([EN-11](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-11)). |
| <a id="rule-dx-05"></a>DX-05 | **A failed phase stops the sequence.** It never proceeds "to get to a consistent state", because the consistent state is the one before the failure. |
| <a id="rule-dx-06"></a>DX-06 | **Every phase's outcome is recorded** with its checks, its operator and its time, so a later incident can reconstruct what ran. |

## 2. The cloud deployment sequence

### 2.1 Phases

```
 0  PRE-FLIGHT      artifact identity · gate evidence · approval
 1  EXPAND          additive schema only — new columns, new tables, new indexes
 2  BACKFILL        populate new structures; old code still reads old structures
 3  DEPLOY          roll the new application version across replicas
 4  SOAK            observe at the new version under real traffic
 5  SWITCH          enable behaviour that depends on the new structures (policy flag)
 6  CONTRACT        remove what nothing reads any more — a SEPARATE, LATER deployment
```

| Phase | Entry check | Exit check | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 Pre-flight** | Digest matches the CI-produced artifact; every release gate has resolvable evidence ([WP-50.00](../planning/work-packages/50-full-platform-production-release.md#rule-wp-50.00)); environment approval granted ([EN-13](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-13)) | All three pass | Stop. Nothing has changed |
| **1 Expand** | Migration is **additive only** — a machine check, not a reviewer's judgement; forward and backward rehearsal passed against a production-shaped copy ([RG-15](14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-rg-15)) | Schema applied; **the currently deployed version still passes its health checks** | Stop and retain the expanded schema while diagnosing; remove only proven-unused additions through a separate reviewed repair. Additive does not make arbitrary DDL reversal data-safe |
| **2 Backfill** | New structures exist; the backfill is resumable and idempotent | Backfill range coverage complete; **no read path depends on it yet** | Stop and resume later. Old code is unaffected because it does not read the new structures |
| **3 Deploy** | Expand applied; the new version is **proven to run against the expanded schema** — this is the compatibility that makes rolling safe | Every replica healthy at the new version; error rate and latency within the release envelope | **Roll back the application** ([EN-14](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-14), one action). The schema stays expanded. Application rollback is allowed only while the declared data/reader compatibility horizon in §2.7 remains open; after closure, use the rehearsed forward-repair or full recovery procedure |
| **4 Soak** | Fleet at the new version | The soak window elapses with no new page-worthy condition and no error-budget burn | Roll back the application. The schema stays expanded |
| **5 Switch** | Soak clean; the new behaviour is behind a policy flag (`§4` of the policy architecture) | The behaviour is on and healthy | A/B: turn the reader flag off while old authority remains current. C: use forward fix or the rehearsed restore; flag-off cannot recover incompatible new facts |
| **6 Contract** | The new version is **irreversibly established**: rollback to the pre-expand version is no longer a permitted action, and no read path touches the removed structure | Removal applied | Stop. A contract failure is the only phase whose reversal needs a restore, which is why `§2.4` gates entry so hard |

### 2.2 Why the phases are separate

| Separation | What it buys |
|---|---|
| Expand before deploy | The old version keeps working, so deploy is reversible |
| Backfill before switch | The new behaviour never reads a half-populated structure |
| Deploy before switch | A bad *deployment* and a bad *behaviour* fail independently and are diagnosed separately |
| Reader switch separate from deploy | A/B can reverse readers within the valid data horizon; C requires an explicit authority cutover |
| Contract as a **separate, later deployment** | The window in which rollback is possible is not shortened by tidying up |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ph-01"></a>PH-01 | **Expand and contract are never in the same deployment.** Combining them removes the rollback path the expand phase exists to preserve. |
| <a id="rule-ph-02"></a>PH-02 | **Contract runs only after the intervening version is established beyond the rollback horizon**, which is a stated duration, not a feeling. |
| <a id="rule-ph-03"></a>PH-03 | **A migration that cannot be expressed as expand-then-contract is a design problem**, escalated rather than executed as a single destructive step ([MG-04](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-mg-04)). |
| <a id="rule-ph-04"></a>PH-04 | **"Migration down" is not the rollback strategy** ([MG-04](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-mg-04)). Rollback is an application rollback or a forward fix. |
| <a id="rule-ph-05"></a>PH-05 | **Migration never runs on application start-up, on any replica** ([MG-01](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-mg-01)). It is a separate gated step with a single executor. |

### 2.3 Mixed-version behaviour during phases 3 and 4

| Situation | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| Old replica reads a row written by a new replica | Unknown fields preserved on round trip; no loss ([SY-09](20-cross-system-lifecycles.md#rule-sy-09) of the lifecycle document) |
| New replica reads a row written by an old replica | New columns absent or default; the new code must tolerate this, and a test asserts it |
| An outbox message enqueued by one version, consumed by the other | Message contracts are additive-only within a major; a consumer ignores unknown fields |
| A background lease taken by an old replica, expiring during deploy | Lease expiry is version-independent; another replica takes it ([BG-02](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-bg-02), [BG-03](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-bg-03)) |
| A long-running task started before the deploy | **Task authority is in the database, not the worker** ([BG-03](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-bg-03)). Its C# authority is replica-independent; the CF Workflow resumes only under a current compatible version/fence |
| A realtime connection to a replica being drained | The client reconnects and **reconciles unconditionally** ([GP-03](contracts/03-realtime-and-bridge.md#rule-gp-03)) |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-mx-01"></a>MX-01 | **Both orderings are tested**, not just old-then-new ([CM-07](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-07) of the quality contract) — a client or replica newer than its peer is as normal as the reverse. |
| <a id="rule-mx-02"></a>MX-02 | **A message or row written by either version is readable by the other**, for the whole rolling window. |
| <a id="rule-mx-03"></a>MX-03 | **Draining a replica completes or releases its in-flight work**; it never abandons a lease silently. |

### 2.4 The rollback horizon

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-rh-01"></a>RH-01 | The rollback horizon permits application-only reversal while old data remains authoritative/representable. A/B normally retain it to contract; C closes its data horizon at cutover. The durable migration epoch is the authority. |
| <a id="rule-rh-02"></a>RH-02 | Contract closes any remaining horizon. A mode-C cutover may already have closed the data horizon; the two are recorded independently. |
| <a id="rule-rh-03"></a>RH-03 | **Beyond the horizon, recovery is a restore**, with its own drill evidence ([WP-46.03](../planning/work-packages/46-backup-recovery-and-data-health.md#rule-wp-46.03)) — a materially more expensive operation, and the reason the horizon is generous by default. |
| <a id="rule-rh-04"></a>RH-04 | **A security fix may close the horizon early**, and that is a decision with its own record, not an exception taken quietly. |

---

### 2.5 Versioned capture, backfill and cutover

Starting capture before backfill is necessary but insufficient. **Counterexample:** backfill reads row v1; capture applies v2; delayed backfill overwrites the target with v1. Both timestamps satisfy the previous check, yet the target is stale. The mechanism must prevent regression and close the writer/cutover race.

| Mode | Authority until contract | Required conversion and rollback |
|---|---|---|
| A — derived (default) | Old representation | Every new reader's value is a deterministic derivation of old data. New-version writes still write the old authority; a synchronous database capture applies the derivation. Application rollback remains safe through the horizon. |
| B — lossless conversion | Old representation during the mixed-version horizon | New-version writers convert their inputs losslessly to the old authority; capture derives the new structure. The converter must round-trip every permitted write. New-only facts remain disabled until contract; if they cannot be represented, choose C. No bidirectional trigger loop or last-writer-wins pair of authorities. |
| C — incompatible new facts | Old until the recorded cutover; new afterwards | A bounded, announced write pause fences all old writers, validates conversion and changes authority. Old-version traffic remains blocked after switching. Data rollback closes at that point; a flag-off alone is not recovery. |

```
EXPAND: install database-enforced capture and migration epoch fence
        under a brief writer gate; wait for prior writers before enabling it
BACKFILL: bounded key ranges; read (key, source_revision, payload/deleted) atomically
          apply only if source_revision > target.source_revision
CAPTURE: same version predicate, same converter, durable delete tombstones
DEPLOY/SOAK: capture continues for writers from every deployed version
CUTOVER: hold exclusive writer fence, drain pre-fence writers/capture,
         verify range coverage and target equivalence at the barrier,
         change reader epoch (and authority only in C), then release fence
CONTRACT: after recorded rollback horizon, fence, disable old writers,
          verify converter/capture no longer needed, remove old structure separately
```

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-bf-01"></a>BF-01 | Migration declares mode, converters, supported old/new versions, row version/tombstone scheme, range manifest, capture mode and maximum fence duration before execution. |
| <a id="rule-bf-02"></a>BF-02 | A database trigger on every affected source write takes the migration epoch's shared transaction lock and assigns/increments the key's source revision in the same transaction. Expand installs it under the exclusive gate after pre-existing writers drain. New code alone cannot cover old replicas. |
| <a id="rule-bf-03"></a>BF-03 | Backfill reads payload and source revision in one snapshot. Both capture and backfill use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE ... WHERE incoming.source_revision > target.source_revision`. Equal revision requires equal canonical hash; disagreement fails migration. The per-key version and delete tombstone survive physical source deletion until the migration horizon. |
| <a id="rule-bf-04"></a>BF-04 | Convergence requires **all** range-manifest entries complete with resumable receipts; version-preserving capture from before the snapshot; no conversion error/dead letter; and a fenced cutover comparison of keys, source revisions, tombstones and canonical hashes. A pair of timestamps or an empty queue read without the writer fence proves none of these. |
| <a id="rule-bf-05"></a>BF-05 | Capture and the epoch fence cover every old/new write throughout deploy, soak and switch. Mode A/B retains old authority and conversion until contract. |
| <a id="rule-bf-06"></a>BF-06 | Synchronous capture is the default. An optional asynchronous variant uses a transactional capture outbox for **every** source write, keyed by entity revision. At cutover the exclusive gate blocks new source writers and waits for existing writers; the applier drains **all committed unapplied rows** before comparison. A sequence-number maximum or an unfenced momentary queue depth is not a drain proof. |
| <a id="rule-bf-07"></a>BF-07 | Full key/revision/hash comparison is partitioned and rehearsed at production scale. A bounded fence finalises changed-key verification against the completed range manifest; any unverified dirty range blocks switching. Samples are additional diagnostics. If the proven fence bound cannot be met, schedule an explicit maintenance window rather than claim an online cutover. |
| <a id="rule-bf-08"></a>BF-08 | Readers switch to a durable migration epoch under the exclusive gate after convergence. Writers/adapters must support that epoch. A/B keep synchronous capture or transactionally validated read-through while readers use the new structure; an asynchronous stale target cannot silently serve acknowledged values. |
| <a id="rule-bf-09"></a>BF-09 | Exceeding the cutover budget aborts **before** changing authority, leaves old authority/capture active and releases the pause. After a successful C cutover, old writers are rejected; restart cannot reopen them. |

`platform.migration_epoch(migration_id PK, mode, epoch, authority, capture_state, fence_state, rollback_open, changed_at)` is the durable control record. `migration_range(migration_id, range_id PK, lower_key, upper_key, snapshot_id, resume_key, state, verification_hash)` records coverage. `migration_capture` uses unique `(migration_id, entity_key, source_revision)` with payload/tombstone/hash and applied receipt. Capture/install, applier and migration executors have separate least-privilege roles; application replicas never run DDL. All fences are transaction-scoped and released on crash; durable epoch/authority determines safe recovery before writes resume.

### 2.6 Rollback data semantics

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-rw-01"></a>RW-01 | A/B application rollback is safe only while every allowed write remains representable in and committed to old authority. C closes data rollback at its authority switch, even if the old tables still exist. |
| <a id="rule-rw-02"></a>RW-02 | A/B capture remains active after reader switch until the explicit contract event; no new-only behaviour starts before the recorded rollback horizon closes. |
| <a id="rule-rw-03"></a>RW-03 | Deployment evidence records schema horizon and data horizon independently, with mode, epoch and the event that closes each. |
| <a id="rule-rw-04"></a>RW-04 | Beyond the data horizon use forward repair or a rehearsed restore with declared data-loss window. Do not present an application rollback or flag toggle as lossless. |
| <a id="rule-rw-05"></a>RW-05 | Pre-rollback tooling checks current epoch, writer compatibility, converter liveness and representability; it refuses an unsafe target. |
| <a id="rule-rw-06"></a>RW-06 | A interrupted capture/backfill replays versioned receipts and cannot overwrite a newer target. After capture failure, switching/rollback is blocked until complete convergence is re-established. |

### 2.7 Phase-entry and exit evidence

| Phase | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Expand | Old writer fixture passes under the installed capture/fence; source update/delete increments the per-key version transactionally. |
| Backfill | All bounded ranges covered; forced delayed v1 backfill cannot replace captured v2 or a v3 tombstone. Crash resumes from durable range receipts. |
| Deploy/soak | Both versions write through the declared converter; no permitted fact is lost by conversion or rollback. |
| Switch | New source writer blocked at fence, in-flight writer drained, every committed capture applied, all dirty ranges verified, epoch transition atomic; mode-C rollback closure recorded. |
| Contract | Horizon explicitly closed; old writers denied before capture/table removal; post-contract restore/forward-fix path rehearsed. |

## 3. Configuration and secrets at deploy time

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-cf-01"></a>CF-01 | **Environments are configuration, not builds** ([EP-01](14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-ep-01)). The same digest runs in staging and production. |
| <a id="rule-cf-02"></a>CF-02 | **Configuration files hold references, never long-lived plaintext secrets** ([CS-01](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-cs-01) of the cloud architecture); production secrets use Cloudflare Worker secrets or Secrets Store with environment-separated bindings, least privilege, audited access and rotation ([CS-02](05-cloud-architecture.md#rule-cs-02) there). |
| <a id="rule-cf-03"></a>CF-03 | CI uses workload federation where the target supports it. Cloudflare Wrangler uses a least-privilege account/Worker-scoped API token in the protected deployment environment, with expiry, rotation and audit. Never use a personal Global API key or log credentials. See [EN-08](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-08) and the [official CI authentication profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/). |
| <a id="rule-cf-04"></a>CF-04 | **Staging and production use different deployment identities**, neither holding subscription-owner rights ([EN-09](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-09)). |
| <a id="rule-cf-05"></a>CF-05 | **A missing or malformed required configuration value fails start-up with a named key**, never a default that silently changes behaviour. |
| <a id="rule-cf-06"></a>CF-06 | **A secret rotation is a configuration change, not a deployment.** The application re-reads on a defined schedule or on a signal, so rotating does not require a release. |
| <a id="rule-cf-07"></a>CF-07 | **IaC state is a secret** ([EN-06](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-06)), stored in a secured backend, never in version control, and separated per environment. |
| <a id="rule-cf-08"></a>CF-08 | **Portal-driven production change is prohibited** ([EN-07](../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md#rule-en-07)); an emergency manual change is reconciled back into IaC promptly, and drift detection runs regularly. |

## 3.1 Configuration activation — a separate lifecycle from deployment

[DC-01](../requirements/11-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-dc-01)–[DC-17](../requirements/11-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-dc-17) make deployment configuration the production policy source. **Replacing it is not a deployment**, and conflating the two is how a price change ends up requiring an image rebuild — which [DC-02](../requirements/11-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-dc-02) exists to prevent.

```

## 4. Client release execution

Client and cloud releases are decoupled ([EP-04](14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-ep-04)), so this sequence runs independently of `§2`.

### 4.1 Desktop

```
build once (per RID) → sign → publish to the artifact store
   → update feed entry: version, hashes, compatibility range, minimum versions
   → channel promotion: nightly → beta → stable
   → client discovers, verifies hash and signature, stages, applies
```

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-cd-01"></a>CD-01 | **The product's own feed is authoritative; storage is replaceable** (`§7` of the build architecture, confirmed independently by [AC-17](19-product-implementation-maps.md#rule-ac-17) of the AionUI matrix). |
| <a id="rule-cd-02"></a>CD-02 | **A client verifies hash and signature before applying**, and a corrupted artifact is rejected rather than installed ([WP-50.02](../planning/work-packages/50-full-platform-production-release.md#rule-wp-50.02)). |
| <a id="rule-cd-03"></a>CD-03 | **An update never interrupts a long-running task.** It stages and applies at a safe point, and the update matrix tests exactly this case. |
| <a id="rule-cd-04"></a>CD-04 | **Downgrade protection is enforced by the feed and by compatibility policy**, so a blocked bad version is refused twice. |
| <a id="rule-cd-05"></a>CD-05 | **An interrupted download or install leaves a working previous installation.** Partial state is never the resting state. |
| <a id="rule-cd-06"></a>CD-06 | **The three professional desktop products version independently** ([CM-02](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-02) of the quality contract), and **mixed-version combinations are actually tested** — nominal independence with de facto lockstep is a failed contract. |

### 4.2 Mobile

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-mr-01"></a>MR-01 | **Store review latency is part of the release plan**, not a surprise. A fix that must reach users quickly cannot depend on a store round trip. |
| <a id="rule-mr-02"></a>MR-02 | **Android release is verified on real devices** ([PM-03](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-pm-03) of the quality contract), against the signed Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Android release artifact. |

### 4.3 Web

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-cw-01"></a>CW-01 | **Static output regenerates byte-identically**, so a deployment that changes nothing produces no diff. |
| <a id="rule-cw-02"></a>CW-02 | **A cached browser bundle must not strand a client on an incompatible version.** Version identity is part of the bundle's cache key. |
| <a id="rule-cw-03"></a>CW-03 | **A web deployment is reversible by redeploying the previous artifact**, which is why the artifact is retained rather than regenerated. |

## 5. The compatibility window

| Axis | Window | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop ↔ desktop, locally | Current stable **and** the immediately previous supported stable line, **both directions** ([CM-03](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-03) of the quality contract) | A floor, not a ceiling ([CM-05](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-05) there) |
| Client ↔ Cloud | Cloud's declared **Supported Client Set** ([CM-06](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-06) there) | Removal is planned and communicated, **never discovered by users** |
| Extension protocol | Current major **and** previous major ([CM-08](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-08) there) | Earlier revocation only for a security reason |
| Native formats | Every format in the Supported Native Format set ([CM-09](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-09) there) | **Format compatibility outlives application interoperability** |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-co-01"></a>CO-01 | **A cloud release must not require a client release on the same day** ([EP-04](14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-ep-04)). If it would, it is not shippable as designed. |
| <a id="rule-co-02"></a>CO-02 | **A minimum-cloud-version requirement is imposed only after every channel has had a genuine opportunity to update** ([EP-05](14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-ep-05)), with the grace period honoured. |
| <a id="rule-co-03"></a>CO-03 | **Every release produces a Compatibility Manifest as a release artifact** ([CM-01](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-01) there), so the window is a published fact rather than an assumption. |
| <a id="rule-co-04"></a>CO-04 | **Read compatibility is not write compatibility** ([CM-10](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#rule-cm-10) there, [I-385](../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-385)). Each is declared and tested separately, so "we can open it" never becomes an implied "we can save it". |

## 6. Deployment failure matrix

| # | Failure | Effect | Detected by | Owner | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="rule-df-01"></a>DF-01 | Expand migration fails part-way | Schema partially expanded | Migration step exit check | Operations | Stop the migration, retain safe unused additions and resume or forward-repair its recorded step; do not run an automatic destructive down migration |
| <a id="rule-df-02"></a>DF-02 | Backfill stalls | New structures partly populated | Backfill progress metric | Operations | Resume; **nothing reads them yet**, so there is no user impact |
| <a id="rule-df-03"></a>DF-03 | Deploy fails on some replicas | Mixed fleet | Health checks per replica | Operations | Roll back the application; mixed-version tolerance (`§2.3`) makes this safe |

| <a id="rule-df-05"></a>DF-05 | Switch flag causes a regression | New behaviour bad | Alerting, error budget | Operations | Check the durable A/B/C epoch and rollback horizon: only compatible A/B may restore the prior reader; after C cutover use verified forward repair or fresh-environment restore |
| <a id="rule-df-06"></a>DF-06 | Contract removes something still read | Errors on a live path | Immediate errors | Operations | **Restore** ([RH-03](#rule-rh-03)). This is why `§2.1` gates contract entry on "no read path touches it" |

Forward fix or restore ([RW-04](#rule-rw-04)) |
| <a id="rule-df-15"></a>DF-15 | Capture stopped before contract | The old representation goes stale, silently closing the data-rollback window while the schema window still looks open | Capture liveness check ([RW-02](#rule-rw-02), [BF-05](#rule-bf-05)) | Operations | **Restart capture and re-backfill the gap**, then treat the window as closed until convergence is re-established |
| <a id="rule-df-16"></a>DF-16 | An unfenced empty backlog was mistaken for convergence | A writer can commit between check and switch | Exclusive epoch-fence test | Operations | Block source writes, drain in-flight writers and committed capture, verify dirty ranges, then switch or abort |

## [P2-009](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) independent artifact deployment and restore

Cloud owns deploy/integration-manifest.v1.json: schemaVersion=1, manifestId, sourceCommits{repo:sha}, packages[{id,version,sha256,license,rid?}], contracts[{package,major,descriptorSha256}], cloudImage:{registry:"registry.cloudflare.com/<account>/cloud",digest,rid:"linux-x64"}, worker:{name,versionId,sourceSha,compatibilityDate,migrationTag}, web:[{profile,artifactHash,configSchema,sourceSha}], products:[{product,platform,rid,version,versionCode?,artifactHash,signatureRef,sourceSha,nativeProfile?,dataCompatibility}], database:{engine:"d1",schemaHash,planManifestHash,migrationFrom,migrationTo,rollbackFloor}, configVersion, testEvidence[{scenario,artifactHash,result}], createdAt, signer, signature. Record the actual deployed Wrangler/SDK version and compatibility date from the immutable build manifest; no independent hardcoded Design patch version. Cloud Container image uses Cloudflare's registry; release executables/static artifacts use their declared distribution channel. All digests and IDs must resolve to produced artifacts.

Per-repo locked restore/build/mock tests → immutable producer candidate → consumer candidate restore/AOT/Kotlin Android/browser tests → isolated real C#/D1/CF/R2 deployment → exact manifest integration suite → approve/promote same bytes. Fork/untrusted PR code gets no deployment secrets; trusted CI promotes reviewed commit with short-lived credentials and dedicated test realm/service account, unique resources,24h cleanup TTL. Tests enter the isolated Worker TLS origin and reach the Container through its private binding; storage.internal stays private. A directly public C# origin or runner localhost cannot substitute for the production route/binding graph. Test artifacts use no real customer content. No submodules/latest/floating branch fixtures.

Rolling upgrade: expand DB/internal/public read schemas → backfill from watermark → deploy C# dual readers → deploy compatible Worker (old workflows drain on their pinned worker version) → canary/soak ≥24h → activate config reader head → clients independently update within supported window → contract only after all old workflows drained and rollback horizon closed. Incompatible Worker code is a new workflow class/migration tag; no hot reinterpretation of checkpoints. Rollback before contract restores prior image/Worker/config/assets; after destructive contraction use verified forward repair or fresh-environment restore, not blind old binary startup. Selfhost operator supplies own CF resources/AWS disaster copy/DB/secrets/origins/realm, same one-host architecture.

Use [the CF/object recovery contract](contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md#6-r2-lifecycle-and-independent-recovery) for the independent S3 COMPLIANCE 30-day backup, D1 export/change archive/object manifests and recovery generation. Observability join request/task/run/attempt/outbox IDs over W3C traceparent across C#/Worker/device with redaction; expose CF dispatch lag/unknown attempts/R2 transfer failures/backup lag/lease conflicts. CF/R2 outage leaves hydrated desktop editing/acquisition/rendering usable within existing per-product offline rules; AI pauses/fails with durable reasons and support/export stay truthful. Full recovery tested after WP46+52 and before 50.

The [CF contract](contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md) specifies stable Workflow/version IDs, C# current authority, per-store deletion receipts and restore generation. Preserve the expand/backfill/soak/switch/contract and rollback evidence above across both C# and Worker; product versions remain independent. R2 bucket-lock settings are not S3 ObjectLock headers, and a second R2 bucket does not satisfy the separate-provider disaster copy.

## Recovery generation and safety journal

D1 remains the sole authority for positive business state, balances, content and transaction outcomes. An independent append-only **safety journal** contains only restrictive facts: revoked user/device/credential IDs and auth epochs, account/workspace purge fences, external dispatch intent identities/hashes and independently observed reconciliation receipts. It cannot create a grant, restore content, settle a customer charge or pronounce an absent effect successful. Use the already selected separate-account AWS S3 COMPLIANCE store with signed immutable objects, conditional creation and a versioned signed head. The production writer cannot delete/shorten retention; restore needs a separate credential and verified complete inventory. Records contain opaque IDs/hashes and bounded reason/state, no prompt/content/credential plaintext. Retain every restrictive fence needed by any retained recovery point and credential/command replay lifetime; permanent non-reused identity tombstones follow the existing security retention policy.

For an external act: commit owner state, intent, receipt and outbox in one guarded D1 batch first, append and verify its safety-journal dispatch barrier outside that transaction, then call the external owner. A barrier without an outcome is possibly dispatched. For revocation/deletion: commit denial and its audit/outbox fence in a guarded D1 batch immediately, append and verify the independent fence before acknowledging success externally. Until that receipt, report pending and retry the same journal write; never report durable cross-disaster revocation complete. External journal I/O is a separate call after the D1 batch; no D1 transaction is held across that call. A lost journal response reconciles by immutable record ID/hash; no blind second external effect. The journal is a fail-closed dependency for new irreversible dispatch and acknowledged security denial; ordinary reads and local native work do not depend on it.

Before reopening a restored realm, allocate recoveryGeneration greater than the latest independently retained generation using conditional update of the signed S3 head, not the restored D1 counter. Fence the prior deployment at ingress and credentials before advancing; two active generations are forbidden. Restore the paired D1 export/bookmark and R2 object inventory, replay the verified ordered change archive to the selected recovery point, then replay all restrictive journal facts after the chosen recovery point (including deletions and revocations absent from that database), then invalidate sessions/PAT/native-auth flows/upload grants, CF leases, event/sync/bootstrap/page cursors and device execution grants. A deleted identity cannot return through fresh login. If the journal/head inventory is incomplete or unverifiable, normal access and dispatch stay closed; expose only incident/recovery status.

Restored external outboxes, accepted-but-unsettled intents and unresolved device commands start quarantined. Match journal barriers and independent provider/device status or receipts before deciding safe continuation. A missing intent in the restored D1 database or a missing remote receipt is not proof that an act never happened; preserve an unknown-effect record using the journal identity and operator reconciliation. No inferred customer debit or duplicate dispatch is allowed. Pure reads, receipt replays and operations whose current owner proves idempotency/no prior effect may resume under a new current-generation authorization; unsafe acts require explicit fresh user/operator authorization after their uncertainty is displayed. Payment-provider inbox reconciliation uses provider event identity, never invents credits from a restore delta.

RequestMeta, SessionView/NativeSession and all cursors bind recoveryGeneration. A client seeing a different generation stops outbound mutations, preserves old command IDs/payloads and uploads in a quarantined recovery view, invalidates read cursors and performs a fresh authenticated bootstrap. It must not relabel old commands with the new generation or automatically replay them after login. Compare preserved local changes with current acknowledged owner data; only an explicit reviewed reapply creates a new command/revision. Native capture/media files and pending Notes content remain available through their existing guarded recovery paths. A workspace-only purge uses the same content fence and explicit re-import boundary without deleting the account.

WP46 implements the journal/generation/restore mechanisms and early fixture rehearsals; WP52 supplies real active/waiting/unknown CF work, and WP50 performs the joined fresh-environment drill. Counterexamples: deletion acknowledged after the backup then restore; provider accepts after backup but before the guarded D1 outcome commit; queued device write whose receipt is outside the restored DB; old offline edit reconnect; journal outage/lost acknowledgement; competing recovery generation allocation. No old access or blind external replay may result. Recovery reports the selected point and actual data-loss window; the RPO is not a zero-loss claim.

## Partial integration manifests and mobile rescue release

The integration manifest also carries stage:bootstrap/ownerCandidate/familyCandidate/release and expectedOwners:Key[]. Before Cloud exists, each producer records a signed candidate manifest in its own repository's build output. WP21 introduces Cloud's consolidated manifest using those exact records; absent future artifacts are absent and listed as pending owners, not fabricated IDs. familyCandidate/release requires every accepted repository's selected source/package closure, all required desktop/mobile RIDs, all Web public/account/chat/operator profiles, actual Worker/image/config/database identities and their passing evidence. A partial manifest cannot pass family release or public download gates. Stage ownership and the first real producer are fixed in [planning](../planning/README.md#staged-artifact-integration).

Android store rollback is a **forward rescue release**: prior known-good behavior rebuilt against a compatible current data schema, signed by the same app identity, with a fresh versionName and versionCode greater than every published/installed code in that channel. This is new code/artifact requiring the applicable gates; it is not same-byte channel promotion. Never promise an in-place install of a lower versionCode. If old behavior cannot read current data, forward-fix or explicit tested data recovery is required. [Android version rules](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning) govern the store/install constraint. Desktop/cloud/Web rollback remains bound to its actual reader/data horizon.

## Migration-mode-aware release and receipt gate

ModeA changes derived state only and may rebuild it. ModeB retains verified old/new read-write compatibility through the rollback horizon. ModeC has a write-paused/fenced cutover and must declare the last compatible write point in the manifest; after incompatible writes or contraction, an old binary/config flag is not a recovery route. Use tested forward repair or fresh-environment restore, then replay restrictive safety journal and switch recovery generation before any credentials/effects reopen. Twenty-four-hour soak and the seven-day Workflow drain do not override this compatibility condition. Every phase/rehearsal statement above is evaluated against the selected mode, not as unconditional old-binary rollback.

Independent copy objectives remain PG5 minute/blob15 minute RPO,30 day COMPLIANCE retention,4 hour RTO. Artifact rollback and data restore have separate receipts. A complete release manifest cannot contain unresolved partial producer publication. Policy/config activation uses the exact [closed schemas](contracts/08-extension-and-policy-profiles.md), parent CAS and distinct approval; source traces or mock evidence cannot activate a real provider gate.

## Self-hosted Cloudflare profile — selfhost.v1

Self-hosting deploys the same signed C# Container image, Cloud/AI Workers, D1 plans, DO migrations, Queues/Cron and R2 artifacts into an operator-owned Cloudflare account. It is not a Docker/PostgreSQL alternate runtime. Operator creates its own realm, domains, model/search/mail credentials, OIDC/password configuration, signing trust, budgets and independent immutable backup target. paymentEnabled=false and public Paddle offers disabled by default; no official account/session/credits/paid entitlement crosses realms. Self-host service grants are operator-controlled under the existing entitlement owner, never forged official purchases.

`GET /.well-known/arcforges-realm.json` on the configured API origin is a public discovery exception: schemaVersion=realm.v1, realmId UUID, kind official/selfHosted, apiOrigin, accountOrigin, objectOrigin, supportedContractMajors[], nativeClientRedirects[], authMethods[], passkeyRpId?, signingKeys[{keyId,algorithm:Ed25519,publicKey,notBefore,notAfter}], configGeneration, issuedAt, expiresAt, signature. Maximum 32 KiB, HTTPS only, expiry≤7 days, no credentials. Official trust anchors ship with clients. A self-host profile requires explicit user confirmation of origin/realm/fingerprint (TOFU with optional out-of-band pin); same-origin HTTPS discovery alone cannot replace an already pinned realm/key. Key rollover requires an unexpired old-key signature over the successor and overlap≥30 days; lost keys require an explicit new profile trust ceremony. Never follow cross-origin discovery redirects silently. Clients bind tokens/database/profile state to immutable realmId plus trusted origin/key; changing realm is an explicit separate profile.

Container egress uses arch 05's configured operator origins and no public /internal path. Self-host backup uses independent S3-compatible storage with verified Object Lock COMPLIANCE and 30-day retention (AWS S3 selected official implementation); without this capability production recovery gate cannot pass. Startup validates bindings, route/plan hashes and key inventory. WP21 produces deployment/config/descriptor fixtures; WP46 proves fresh-account export/import/replay and key custody; [PG-25](../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-25)/[L-10](../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-10) block production readiness until actual operator deployment evidence exists.

### Backup manifest v1

schemaVersion, realmId, recoveryGeneration, createdAt, d1Export:{objectRef,sha256,bookmark,schemaHash,planManifestHash,baseSequence}, replay:{firstSequence,lastSequence,segmentHashes[]}, objects:{inventoryRef,inventoryHash,verifiedThrough}, safetyJournal:{head,hash,independentReceipt}, keyInventoryRef, signature. All sequences are exact uint64 strings in JSON. No WAL timeline/LSN or PostgreSQL engine field exists. Restore validates contiguous replay strictly above baseSequence, all referenced immutable bytes and restrictive safety facts before reopening; a Time Travel bookmark alone is not an independent backup.
