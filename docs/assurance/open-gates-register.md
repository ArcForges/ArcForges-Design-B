# Open Gates Register

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Assurance
> Governing authority: **[D-003](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-003)** (verification scope and the first-consumption rule), **[D-016](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-016)** (deferred-decision ownership)
> Companions: [`phase-1-official-verification.md`](phase-1-official-verification.md), [`phase-1-input-review-ledger.md`](phase-1-input-review-ledger.md), [`release-gates.md`](release-gates.md), [`../planning/README.md`](../planning/README.md)

Every gate that Phase 1 deferred, every gate the official verification record created, and every gate Phase 2 adds — in one register, each with an owner, a trigger, what it blocks, and the work package that must satisfy it.

Gates fall into two classes, and the distinction is load-bearing:

| Class | Obligation | Can Phase 2 close it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Design-stage** | The obligation is design or planning evidence — a matrix, an inventory, a mapping | **Yes**, and where Phase 2 produced the evidence the gate is marked `CLOSED` with its artifact named |
| **Implementation-stage** | The obligation is execution evidence — an AOT publish, a hardware result, a received payout, a passing test | **No.** Phase 2 schedules it against a named package; only recorded execution evidence closes it |

A gate is never closed by registering a finding about it, and never closed by a weaker gate passing in its place.

## 1. Register conventions

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **State** | `OPEN` — not yet triggered · `TRIGGERED` — its trigger has fired and it is now blocking · `CLOSED` — satisfied with recorded evidence |
| **Owner** | The accountable role, as recorded in Phase 1 or assigned here |
| **Trigger** | The event that makes the gate due; until then it is not overdue |
| **Blocks** | What cannot proceed while the gate is open after its trigger |
| **Scheduled in** | The work package that must satisfy it ([`../planning/work-packages/README.md`](../planning/work-packages/README.md)) |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-og-01"></a>OG-01 | **A gate is closed only by recorded evidence**, never by assertion. |
| <a id="rule-og-02"></a>OG-02 | **A gate whose trigger has fired and which is not closed blocks the dependent work** — it does not become a warning. |
| <a id="rule-og-03"></a>OG-03 | **A gate may not be silently re-scoped.** Changing a gate requires a decision record. |
| <a id="rule-og-04"></a>OG-04 | **A new gate discovered during implementation is added here**, with the same fields, rather than living only in the document that discovered it. |
| <a id="rule-og-05"></a>OG-05 | Rule identifiers are document-scoped. Every active citation is a direct link to its defining document and stable rule anchor; the same spelling in a different document is a different rule. Retired identifiers link to an explicit historical relocation, and reserved allocation ranges are metadata, not requirements. No unresolved or silently guessed citation is permitted. The complete current-corpus check is the design evidence for [PG-21](#rule-pg-21); subsequent edits must repeat it. |
| <a id="rule-og-06"></a>OG-06 | **[PG-14b](#rule-pg-14b) is deliberately suffixed.** [PG-14](../requirements/products/arcslate.md#rule-pg-14) is already an ArcSlate processing-graph rule in [`../requirements/products/arcslate.md`](../requirements/products/arcslate.md), and reusing the bare number would have made two unrelated obligations indistinguishable in citation. The suffix is the disambiguation [OG-05](#rule-og-05) requires. |

### 2.1 Current Android candidate licence evidence

**Replacement closure (2026-09-19).** [Mobile PR4](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/pull/4)
implements the resource closure; [Mobile PR5](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/pull/5)
repairs API 36 installation-identity verification. The final revision is
`5031d837d2e7bf9dd1b681c837c942d2b74dc65e`, merged after full review and all applicable PR checks.
[Main CI and public upgrade verification](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/actions/runs/35444269638) passed;
the actual [published replacement](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/tag/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1) was independently downloaded and verified.
The [WP00.03 receipt](wp00-03-implementation-evidence.md) records the nine-owner scope.

| Evidence | Verified replacement scope |
|---|---|
| Source process | 110 inventoried files, 19 reused files, 18 retained immutable records, closed licence decisions, complete notices and conflict handling; 49 Python policy and release tests passed. |
| Dependency and resource closure | Contracts `1.0.0-ci.54.1` from `aa2f187a4adae8ee4f79cee192c0d382cb7fec7f`; 195 reviewed components, 122 input archives, four native ABI payloads and 13 complete retained notice texts. All 454 members across release APK/AAB, debug APK and test APK are source/profile-bound. |
| Conflict removal | No original or renamed excluded suffix-data bytes, unused JUnit artwork or source-only annotation resources remain. Explicit `NO_COOKIES` rejects unsolicited cookie persistence. Full JUnit EPL terms remain instrumentation-only; no EPL implementation is ported into owned Apache source. |
| Real candidate checks | Windows/Linux full builds and archive gates passed. Both API 26/36 jobs passed all five instrumentation tests, eight real SDK protocol calls, native UI recreation and a real minified-release Cloud button call per image. |
| Protected publication | All eleven public assets match their release digests. Actual APK/AAB signatures retain certificate `7a8b3b1402e77c3ec78e7a0b9f99d5358adc321d0e8d2a319c838d1cda181e9c`; all original candidate payload members and evidence companions are unchanged. |
| Actual public upgrades | Each API job anonymously downloaded and verified the published APK, upgraded version code 901 to 1401, preserved package UID/first-install time and completed one real Cloud button call. Screenshots and device receipts were reviewed. |

The public [resource receipt](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/resource-provenance.json),
[source receipt](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/source-provenance.json),
[licence closure](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/licence-closure.json),
[full notices](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt),
[signing-preservation receipt](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/signed-resource-provenance.json)
and [release manifest](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.14.1/release.json) bind these checks to the inspected bytes.
This closes [F-023](#rule-f-023) for this candidate only. Future dependency/resource changes must
repeat the gates; store approval, physical devices and full companion behavior
retain their separate requirements.

#### Historical ci.9.1 evidence and reopening

**Historical qualification (2026-09-19).** The evidence below remains valid for its
stated checks, but its earlier full-closure conclusion is superseded by the
[WP00.03 packaged-resource finding](reference-coverage-and-provenance.md#321-current-android-packaged-resources).
The actual published APK/AAB contains MPL-2.0 Public Suffix List data that the
earlier POM/notice audit did not classify separately. The gate was reopened for
that resource closure. Mobile owned the accepted removal and verification;
replacement publication and both device APIs were required before reclosing it.

The [WP-00.02](../planning/work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-wp-00.02)
audit implements the [declaration and Android closure profile](../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#41-project-declaration-and-verification-profile).
[Mobile PR3](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/pull/3) records the complete review,
including the [final review](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/pull/3#issuecomment-5737480990)
and [successful PR checks](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/actions/runs/35406342747).
The merged source is `69155c7c3c2eda592270eeb354677c0537af55ec`.
The [main run](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/actions/runs/35407161182) passed,
and [published release `android-0.1.0-ci.9.1`](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/tag/android-0.1.0-ci.9.1)
was independently downloaded and verified on 2026-09-18 (America/Los_Angeles).
The [post-merge review receipt](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/pull/3#issuecomment-5737657685)
records persistent-signature and public-upgrade verification.

| Evidence | Verified scope |
|---|---|
| First-party ownership | Three Mobile Gradle scopes and all 15 Contracts scopes declare Apache-2.0; source and effective property/reference checks reject incompatible or unknown first-party inputs. The nine-repository inventory covers 75 actual projects. |
| Immutable upstream | Contracts `1.0.0-ci.44.1`, from `199e61565aff33db425f6148a55a7676388a8e8c`, is published and content-verified on NuGet, npm and Maven Central. Mobile consumes only the two exact public Maven modules. |
| Actual resolved closure | 195 reviewed components, 122 unique distributable artifacts, four AndroidX Graphics Path native binaries and 12 complete retained notice texts. Runtime scopes use Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause and MIT; JUnit's EPL-1.0 is instrumentation-only. Native source/compiler provenance and platform library dependencies are recorded. |
| Conflict remediation | The optional GPL-family core-library implementation is removed under the [accepted remediation](../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#42-current-android-dependency-conflict-and-remediation). Its configuration is empty and packaged DEX is checked; JVM 21, minimum API 26, package identity and language desugaring are preserved. |
| Build and candidate | Both OS builds, strict locks/checksums, fourteen policy/release fixtures and an empty-cache full local build passed. The clean merged candidate embeds the same source-bound closure and complete notices in release/debug/test APKs and the AAB; signing re-verifies those exact inputs. |
| Runtime | PR and merged-main CI each passed five instrumentation tests on each of API 26 and 36, actual published-client success/Unicode/error/deadline calls, and one real Cloud button call from the minified candidate on each image. Cloud source was `2cf5a58633a7e09db05ebc1741f1cab83547a832`. |
| Publication and upgrade | Both the actual protected publisher and publication verifier passed. All eight public asset digests and candidate payload entries match; APK/AAB signatures retain the existing certificate. Public version-code 601 to 901 upgrades passed on API 26 and 36, preserving package UID and first-install time, followed by successful real Cloud calls and screenshot review. |

The merged candidate's `licence-closure.json` SHA256 is
`6b1615a5af88796f00427b3561bfcb79c266c319f0a54944e81f4c33f88293ac`;
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` is
`5921c34bb8d0a4e47e82a4051fcf5cfba78180cb04ca18be7028789ef3c74455`.
The public [closure receipt](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.9.1/licence-closure.json),
[retained notices](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.9.1/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt)
and [release manifest](https://github.com/ArcForges/Mobile/releases/download/android-0.1.0-ci.9.1/release.json)
bind the source, locks, dependencies, candidate hashes, published bytes and persistent certificate.

This was the earlier licence-gate closure for the inspected sideloadable candidate;
the historical qualification above reopened its resource claim. It does not approve future dependencies,
Google Play submission, physical devices or full companion-product behavior.
Changed source/dependency/native/packaging closure must pass the same checks before
another artifact; a store submission still requires its applicable store gates.

## 4. Gates created by Phase 2

These are new obligations that follow from Phase 2 architecture rather than from Phase 1. Each is a scheduling obligation, not a reopened decision.

| Gate | Subject | Owner | Trigger | Blocks | Scheduled in | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="rule-pg-01"></a>**PG-01** | The per-product **Reference Coverage Matrix** exists with a disposition for every item (**[D-012](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012)**) | Product Owner with Architecture Owner | Start of that product's implementation planning — **fired and satisfied 2026-09-05** | [P-01](release-gates.md#rule-p-01); that product's first release | Design-stage evidence: [`reference-coverage/`](reference-coverage/README.md) — ArcChat 30 rows, ArcNotes 41, ArcScope 31, ArcSlate 31, distribution 12 | **`CLOSED` 2026-09-05** for all three professional products and the distribution oracle |
| <a id="rule-pg-02"></a>**PG-02** | The **implementation-state reconciliation inventory** exists before repository restructuring begins | Architecture Owner | Before the first restructuring change — **fired and satisfied 2026-09-05** | All restructuring work | Design-stage evidence: [`implementation-state-reconciliation.md`](implementation-state-reconciliation.md) — 166 of 166 projects, 6 of 6 native shims, 28 test suites | **`CLOSED` 2026-09-05** |
| <a id="rule-pg-03"></a>**PG-03** | The **native dependency licence review** per product, against that product's licence boundary ([LD-07](../architecture/12-native-interop-and-media.md#rule-ld-07) in the native architecture) | Licensing and Provenance Owner | First native dependency accepted into a product | That dependency's use | The native interoperability work package | `OPEN` |
| <a id="rule-pg-04"></a>**PG-04** | **Runbook rehearsal evidence**: every required runbook executed at least once, with a dated record ([RB-04](../architecture/13-observability-and-operations.md#rule-rb-04) in the observability architecture) | Operations Owner | Before paid cloud go-live | [L-12](release-gates.md#rule-l-12) | The operations readiness work package | `OPEN` |
| <a id="rule-pg-05"></a>**PG-05** | **Redaction proof**: marker values injected as headers, tokens, prompts and document content never appear in exported telemetry ([TV-01](../architecture/13-observability-and-operations.md#rule-tv-01) there) | Operations Owner | First telemetry export to an external backend | [R-16](release-gates.md#rule-r-16) | The observability work package | `OPEN` |
| <a id="rule-pg-06"></a>**PG-06** | **Design-stage invariant traceability**: every catalogued invariant has an architecture home, an enforcement mechanism, a **planned** verification specification and an owning work-package completion gate (**[D-018](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-018)** obligation B) | Architecture Owner | On completion of the glossary catalogue | Finalising the design baseline | [WP-00.01](../planning/work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-wp-00.01); evidence in [`invariant-coverage.md`](invariant-coverage.md) `§7` | **`CLOSED` 2026-09-05, re-verified against the revised catalogue** — **429 of 429 mapped**. The original closure was 421 of 421; [P2-006](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-006) added [I-491](../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-491)–[I-498](../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-498), and [PR-03](invariant-coverage.md#rule-pr-03) requires the count to be recomputed rather than carried forward, which `§7` does |
| <a id="rule-pg-11"></a>**PG-11** | **Implementation-stage invariant enforcement**: every catalogued invariant has an **implemented** check and a **passing** result (**[D-018](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-018)** obligation C) | Each invariant's owning package owner, coordinated by the Architecture Owner | Each owning package reaching its completion gate | That package's completion gate; and [P-03](release-gates.md#rule-p-03) for the affected product | Distributed across the owning packages listed in [`invariant-coverage.md`](invariant-coverage.md) `§7` | `OPEN` |
| <a id="rule-pg-07"></a>**PG-07** | **Format fixture completeness**: every claimed import format version has a fixture ([ME-03](reference-coverage-and-provenance.md#rule-me-03) in the provenance document) | Product Owner per product | First public import claim for that product | That claim | The per-product import and export work packages | `OPEN` |
| <a id="rule-pg-08"></a>**PG-08** | **Hardware lab inventory**: a maintained device, firmware and driver inventory including a USB device with explicit interface/endpoint identity exists before ArcScope or ArcSlate hardware results are accepted ([TE-03](testing-and-verification-strategy.md#rule-te-03) in the testing strategy) | Quality Owner | First hardware-lab test run | [C-04](release-gates.md#rule-c-04) | The ArcScope and ArcSlate verification work packages | `OPEN` |

## 5. What is deliberately not verified

**[D-003](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-003)** established a verification scope and a first-consumption rule. This register preserves it.

| Category | Position |
|---|---|
| Prices, fees, quotas, rates and commercial figures | **Deliberately not verified.** Deferred under **[D-003](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-003)**'s first-consumption rule with a named owner and trigger; every figure is versioned commercial policy under **[D-020](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020)** |
| Third-party pricing pages and plan tiers | Not verified; verified at first consumption by the owning work package |
| Vendor feature roadmaps | Not verified; only current, documented behaviour is relied upon |
| Reference-repository internals beyond behavioural evidence | Not verified; governed by **[D-012](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012)** and **[D-013](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-013)** |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-nv-01"></a>NV-01 | **An illustrative commercial figure in the current design is a proposal until the required policy approval; it is never an implicit commitment** (**[D-020](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020)**). |
| <a id="rule-nv-02"></a>NV-02 | **Consuming an unverified external fact triggers its verification at that moment** (**[D-003](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-003)**), and the verification result is recorded in the assurance layer. |

## 6. Unresolved determinations

**None.**

Distinct from a gate. A gate has a known obligation awaiting evidence; an **unresolved determination** is a question the accessible material cannot answer. One existed and is closed.

| # | Determination | Resolution | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="rule-oc-01"></a>**OC-01** | **Olive was registered by [D-012](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012) as an ArcSlate reference but was not present** at the authorized reference-map location | **User decision, 2026-09-05** ([P2-005](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-005)): ArcSlate's direct reference repositories are **ArcVideo and ArcVideoFoundation**; there is no requirement to obtain or independently review an Olive repository. Olive could not be built in the user's environment, and ArcVideo carries the modifications made to get that codebase building. **[D-012](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012)**'s reference map is amended accordingly | **`CLOSED` 2026-09-05** |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ud-01"></a>UD-01 | **Closing [OC-01](#rule-oc-01) removed an audit obligation, not a provenance obligation.** ArcVideo is a documented Olive fork; its GPL-3.0 obligations, upstream copyright and attribution to the Olive authors are preserved wherever inherited material requires them (**[D-013](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-013)**; `§3.1` of the ArcSlate matrix). |
| <a id="rule-ud-02"></a>UD-02 | **A future unresolved determination is recorded here** with the same fields, and blocks whatever depends on it until decided. |

---

**Browser deployment decision.** [P2-003](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-003) is now ADOPTED under [P2-008](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-008). This resolves the design choice; [PG-23](#rule-pg-23) carries its real implementation evidence. Gate scope changes from obsolete Blazor/WASM to React/TS are authorized by that decision; native AOT gates are unchanged.

## 7. Register summary

| Class | Count | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Deferred gates carried from Phase 1 | 3 | **[F-013](#rule-f-013) closed**; [F-023](#rule-f-023) closed for the inspected replacement; [F-026](#rule-f-026) remains open |
| Gates created by the verification record | 11 active + 1 retired + 1 merged | [VG-09](#rule-vg-09) retired by [P2-010](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-010); active entries require implementation evidence |
| Gates created by Phase 2 | 26 | Includes citation closure, packaged OS isolation, React/TypeScript Web and Android push delivery |
| **Closed by design-stage evidence** | **5** | [F-013](#rule-f-013), [PG-01](#rule-pg-01), [PG-02](#rule-pg-02), [PG-06](#rule-pg-06), [PG-21](#rule-pg-21) |
| **Closed for a current implementation candidate** | **1** | [F-023](#rule-f-023) is closed for the inspected replacement after source/resource, device, persistent-signature, public-byte and upgrade verification. |
| **Open implementation-stage gates** | **34** | Current, conditional or recurring; [VG-09](#rule-vg-09) is retired under [P2-010](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-010) and one additional entry is merged. Five design closures remain historical design evidence, not runtime pass. |
| Unresolved determinations | **0** | [OC-01](#rule-oc-01) closed by user decision 2026-09-05 ([P2-005](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-005)) |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-rs-01"></a>RS-01 | **A design-stage gate closes on design evidence.** Five currently have. |
| <a id="rule-rs-02"></a>RS-02 | **An implementation-stage gate never closes on design evidence**, however complete that evidence is. |
| <a id="rule-rs-03"></a>RS-03 | **[PG-06](#rule-pg-06) closing does not close [PG-11](#rule-pg-11).** They are different obligations with different evidence; the weaker one passing has no effect on the stronger one. |

## [P2-009](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) evidence boundary

The runtime, protocol and package gate scopes above are amended by [P2-009](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009). Historical official-verification records retain their dated claims; they cannot override the current selected runtime. Cloud AOT and Android Kotlin gates are triggered; [VG-09](#rule-vg-09) is retired by the accepted Android-only scope. Of the 35 implementation obligations, 34 remain open or triggered. [F-023](#rule-f-023) is closed only for the inspected replacement on its actual implementation evidence; writing this design closes none of them. Workers AI/R2 real integration and restore use [PG-10](#rule-pg-10), [PG-13](#rule-pg-13), [PG-18](#rule-pg-18) and the existing full-release gates, with the exact artifacts and failure evidence in the [CF contract](../architecture/contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md).

## Scheduling under the parallel delivery model

Under [P2-018](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018) the gates in this register are acceptance conditions, not start barriers. Each gate's contributing delivery tasks are listed in [gate traceability](../planning/delivery/traceability.md#gates); a contributing task records its scoped evidence, and a gate closes only when every contributing task has recorded the evidence class the gate names. Where an entry above names a work package or substep for a gate, it identifies the obligation that carries the evidence, while the [delivery graph](../planning/delivery/README.md) schedules the tasks. Closed gates keep their recorded scope; a changed artifact meets its applicable gate again without reopening unrelated history.
