# Release Gates

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Assurance
> Governing authority: the Product Quality Contract, **[D-008](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-008)**, **[D-022](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-022)**, **[D-023](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-023)**, **[V-04](phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-04)**, **[V-09](phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-09)**, and the deferred gates **[F-013](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-013)**, **[F-023](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023)**, **[F-026](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-026)**
> Companions: [`testing-and-verification-strategy.md`](testing-and-verification-strategy.md), [`../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md`](../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md), [`../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md`](../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md), [`open-gates-register.md`](open-gates-register.md)

This document consolidates every gate that stands between work and users, in one place, so no gate lives only inside the document that invented it.

**A gate is an explicit condition with a named owner and evidence artifact.** Automated gates are machine-evaluated; local observations and commercial/provider prerequisites record their actual evidence separately.

**Execution applicability.** [P2-017](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) and the [CI/local validation policy](ci-and-local-validation-policy.md) govern every class below. Automated merge/publication gates comprise the retained builds, packaging, offline/static checks, security, signatures and necessary trust-handoff checks. Runtime scenarios describe product behavior and explicit local opt-in observations; they do not require hosted device/emulator/GUI/browser/service/inference/installed-consumer execution or a fresh runtime cycle on every release. Reuse applicable passing local evidence with its exact source and coverage. Unobserved behavior is not reported as passed, and an unavailable optional environment does not block implementation. No macOS CI or routine public-download/hash/install verification is authorized by this register. Real commercial and provider prerequisites remain distinct from CI success.

## 1. Gate classes

| Class | When evaluated | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| **G — Continuous** | Every pull request and main build | Merge |
| **R — Per-release** | Applicable automated build/package gates per candidate; local observations under P2-017 | Promotion under the applicable channel requirements |
| **C — Channel promotion** | Moving a release between channels | That promotion |
| **P — Product first release** | The first public release of a product | That product's launch |
| **L — Go-live** | The first time a paid or externally exposed capability opens | That capability's launch |
| **D — Deferred-gate closure** | When a deferred gate's trigger fires | The work that depends on it |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ga-01"></a>GA-01 | **A gate result is recorded with its evidence artifact** in the release record ([RC-03](../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md#rule-rc-03) in the distribution requirements). |
| <a id="rule-ga-02"></a>GA-02 | **A gate is either passed or blocked.** There is no "passed with concerns"; a concern is either a defect or a waiver. |
| <a id="rule-ga-03"></a>GA-03 | **A waiver is explicit, owned and expiring** (`§21.1` of the quality contract). An expired waiver blocks release automatically. |
| <a id="rule-ga-04"></a>GA-04 | **A gate may not be waived if it protects data integrity, security, licence compliance or a regulatory obligation.** |
| <a id="rule-ga-05"></a>GA-05 | **Adding a gate is cheap; removing one requires a recorded decision.** |

## 4. C — Channel promotion gates

| # | Gate | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="rule-c-01"></a>C-01 | All per-release gates passed for this exact artifact — no rebuild ([BR-01](../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-01) in the build architecture) | Every promotion |
| <a id="rule-c-02"></a>C-02 | Soak and scale results within budget for the promotion's duration requirement ([F-14](testing-and-verification-strategy.md#rule-f-14)) | Beta → Stable |
| <a id="rule-c-03"></a>C-03 | Cross-platform matrix complete for every supported platform and architecture (`§20` of the quality contract) | Beta → Stable |
| <a id="rule-c-04"></a>C-04 | Hardware-lab verification complete for ArcScope and ArcSlate ([F-18](testing-and-verification-strategy.md#rule-f-18)) | Beta → Stable for those products |

---

## 5. P — Product first-release gates

| # | Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| <a id="rule-p-01"></a>P-01 | The product's **Reference Coverage Matrix** is complete, with a disposition for every item (**[D-012](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012)**; [CM-07](reference-coverage-and-provenance.md#rule-cm-07) in the provenance document) | Matrix |
| <a id="rule-p-02"></a>P-02 | The product's **licence audit** is complete — the **[F-013](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-013)** trigger has fired and been satisfied for this product (**[D-013](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-013)**) | Audit record |
| <a id="rule-p-03"></a>P-03 | The product's Quality Contract instance is populated with measured values, not targets (`§1` of the quality contract) | Quality report |
| <a id="rule-p-04"></a>P-04 | Must-pass release scenarios pass for this product, including every applicable initial-state row of the [offline acceptance matrix](testing-and-verification-strategy.md#offline-acceptance-matrix). Record enrollment/hydration/authorization and restart outcomes; no generic Cloud-authoritative editable-workspace assumption substitutes for the product behavior | Scenario results |
| <a id="rule-p-05"></a>P-05 | ArcScope/ArcSlate portable packages round-trip completely. Notes Cloud/cached export reports declared fidelity and missing resources. Every application assistant exports/imports assistant-history.v1 locally or from its admitted Cloud scope under model 05, without implicit promotion. | Owner-specific round-trip or complete fidelity/exclusion report |
| <a id="rule-p-06"></a>P-06 | Cross-product launch/handoff is future-only. Current assistant navigation opens resources inside its own application; remote operations target an already authorized application through Cloud. | [Future boundary](../future/cross-product-collaboration/README.md) |
| <a id="rule-p-07"></a>P-07 | Deep links, file associations and single-instance routing verified (`§7`, `§8` of the shared desktop requirements) | Test results |
| <a id="rule-p-08"></a>P-08 | Diagnostics, crash reporting and consent behaviour verified (`§9` of the observability architecture) | Test results |

## 6. L — Go-live gates

### 6.1 Paid cloud go-live

**The threshold is "failure behaves correctly", not "the happy path works."** (`§12` of the cloud product requirements)

| # | Gate |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-l-01"></a>L-01 | A full **Game Day** exercising SEV0 through SEV2 scenarios against the real production topology |

| <a id="rule-l-14"></a>L-14 | Status page live, independently hosted, with the emergency alternate URL published (`§8` of the observability architecture) |
| <a id="rule-l-15"></a>L-15 | Alert-to-runbook mapping complete; on-call responder arrangement in place (`§7` there) |
| <a id="rule-l-16"></a>L-16 | The selected [launch-capacity.v1](../architecture/data-model/04-d1-execution-profile.md#launch-capacity-profile-v1) has recorded Product/Operations cost/performance approval and real production-shaped evidence: standard-2/four-slot routing, ten-minute idle sleep and cold first response, exact workload/stream/D1 footprint, Vectorize vector/namespace and R2 byte/object/Class A/Class B/served-byte budgets, threshold reservations/rescue and 30-day headroom. Include actual configuration hashes and unit-cost/duty-cycle results. [PG-26](open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-26) remains open until these pass; document/SQLite checks cannot close it. |

### 6.2 Commercial go-live

**Until funds are actually received, the correct statement is "technical integration complete" — not "the commercial loop is closed."** (`§18` of the commerce requirements)

| # | Gate |
|---|---|

|---|---|
| <a id="rule-l-40"></a>L-40 | Every one of the eight Mainland China pre-enablement gates recorded as met before that route is enabled (**[D-023](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-023)**) |
| <a id="rule-l-41"></a>L-41 | The route remains disabled by configuration until [L-40](#rule-l-40) is satisfied, and the configuration state is verified in the release gate ([RG-04](../architecture/16-billing-and-commerce-architecture.md#rule-rg-04) in the commerce architecture) |

### 6.4 Mobile release

| # | Gate |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-l-50"></a>L-50 | **[F-023](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023)**: complete direct and transitive dependency closure verified before the first artifact is produced (**[D-004](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-004)**; [PL-06](../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md#rule-pl-06) in the distribution requirements) |
| <a id="rule-l-51"></a>L-51 | **[V-09](phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-09)**: store category fit and consumption-only conformance confirmed by review, not by reading the guideline ([PL-07](../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md#rule-pl-07) there) |
| <a id="rule-l-52"></a>L-52 | Commerce-prohibition build check passes: no purchase surface, no embedded checkout, no store billing, no external purchase call to action, **no licence-key or purchase-token unlock path** ([MC-01](../architecture/11-mobile-architecture.md#rule-mc-01)–[MC-06](../architecture/11-mobile-architecture.md#rule-mc-06) in the mobile architecture) |
| <a id="rule-l-53"></a>L-53 | Android runtime posture confirmed by inspecting the produced release artifact, not the project file ([RT-07](../architecture/11-mobile-architecture.md#rule-rt-07) there) |
| <a id="rule-l-54"></a>L-54 | Release artifact built by retained CI. Any device observation is explicit local opt-in under P2-017, with its actual artifact and coverage recorded; it is not a hosted or repeated post-publication gate ([RT-08](../architecture/11-mobile-architecture.md#rule-rt-08) there). |
| <a id="rule-l-55"></a>L-55 | Store developer account established under the intended long-term owning identity ([PL-05](../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md#rule-pl-05) in the distribution requirements) |

### 6.5 Extension platform opening

| # | Gate |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-l-60"></a>L-60 | Extension protocol conformance suite passes against a reference extension covering every contribution kind ([XT-01](../architecture/15-extension-platform-architecture.md#rule-xt-01) in the extension architecture) |
| <a id="rule-l-61"></a>L-61 | Isolation suite passes: crash, hang, memory exhaustion and unbounded output each leave the host healthy |
| <a id="rule-l-62"></a>L-62 | Permission presentation, grant, re-consent and revocation verified end to end |
| <a id="rule-l-63"></a>L-63 | Catalog-as-untrusted suite passes |
| <a id="rule-l-64"></a>L-64 | Public SDK compatibility commitment published, with the protocol and SDK versions separated (`§10` there) |

---

Commercial activation evidence for [L-23](#rule-l-23)–[L-30](#rule-l-30) is produced by WP48/WP50. WP42.10 supplies technical/test-mode receipts and the activation checklist; a real customer checkout and received payout are not prerequisites of WP42.

## 7. D — Deferred-gate closure

| Gate | Trigger | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[F-013](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-013)** — reference licence determinations | The first step of a product's Reference Coverage Matrix and licence audit, before substantive reference source is used for planning or implementation (**[D-013](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-013)**) | Licensing and Provenance Owner | [P-02](#rule-p-02) for that product |
| **[F-023](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023)** — mobile provenance and dependency closure | Before the first mobile artifact is produced (**[D-004](../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-004)**) | Release Engineering Owner and Licensing and Provenance Owner; Product Owner approves | [L-50](#rule-l-50) |
| **[F-026](open-gates-register.md#rule-f-026)** — generated protobuf/gRPC client AOT packaging | First use of the generated protobuf/gRPC client on an AOT or trimmed target | Architecture Owner | [R-03](#rule-r-03) for any target consuming it |

Full state is tracked in [`open-gates-register.md`](open-gates-register.md).

## 8. Gate ownership

| Gate class | Accountable role |
|---|---|
| G | Architecture Owner |
| R | Release Engineering Owner |
| C | Release Engineering Owner |
| P | Product Owner, with the Architecture Owner for [P-01](#rule-p-01), [P-02](#rule-p-02), [P-06](#rule-p-06) |
| L (cloud) | Operations Owner |
| L (commercial) | Product Owner |
| L (regional) | Product Owner |
| L (mobile) | Release Engineering Owner |
| L (extension) | Architecture Owner |
| D | As recorded per gate |

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-go-01"></a>GO-01 | **A gate without a named accountable role is not deployed.** |
| <a id="rule-go-02"></a>GO-02 | **The accountable role approves the evidence, not the intention.** |
| <a id="rule-go-03"></a>GO-03 | **Roles are functions, not individuals**, and the current holder is recorded in the planning layer. |

## React/TypeScript Web release evidence

[P2-008](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-008) replaces the Web runtime proof with Node-built Site/Account/Chat artifacts. [PG-23](open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-23) requires real C#/TS SDK and session/realtime compatibility, consumer visual/accessibility/performance evidence, esproj/CLI workflow checks, exact-value correctness, npm provenance/SBOM and coherent edge/asset rollback. Existing native AOT and real commercial provider gates remain independent.


## [P2-009](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) deployment closure

Release consumes one tested immutable [integration manifest](../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#14-independent-producer-and-consumer-artifact-gates): independent product and package versions, Cloud image, Worker version, proto descriptor and storage/migration compatibility. The full gate includes the activated [VG-06](open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-06), Kotlin/ART Android proof, real CF inference/R2 transfer and cross-provider recovery after both [WP-46](../planning/work-packages/46-backup-recovery-and-data-health.md#rule-wp-46) and [WP-52](../planning/work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52). Provider uncertainty, object verification, user revocation and rollback cannot pass with mocks. First-party native packages retain every RID, isolation, provenance and hardware gate. Product release versions need not move together.

## Scheduling under the parallel delivery model

Under [P2-018](../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018) every condition in this register is unchanged. Release gates are met by the release tasks of the [delivery graph](../planning/delivery/README.md), which depend on the package acceptances and real integration evidence they require; package acceptance is a roll-up for release tasks and never a start prerequisite for implementation work ([DLV-35](../planning/delivery/README.md#rule-dlv-35)). The family release joins evidence that earlier integration tasks already recorded; it is not the first real integration.
