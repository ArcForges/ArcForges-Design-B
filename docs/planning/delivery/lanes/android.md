## Tasks

<a id="task-and-01"></a>

### AND.01 — Android production identity and stable toolchain reconciliation

**Outcome.** com.arcforges.mobile applicationId/namespace/source packages adopted, and a mutually compatible stable JDK21/AGP/Kotlin/Compose/Gradle tuple is pinned with wrapper checksums, version-catalog locks and generated-client compatibility evidence.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M · early risk proof |
| Obligations | [WP-30.00](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.00) — all work except the parts mapped to AND.04<br>[WP-30](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30) §3 binding rules: Apache-2.0 boundary, no GPL-family implementation, immutable producer artifacts — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | android-app-identity; android-stable-toolchain |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [PRF.10](runtime-proofs.md#task-prf-10) — immutable toolchain compatibility manifest (exact AGP/Kotlin/Compose/Gradle versions proven together on a real release build). *Why:* WP30.00 Follow-up F-1 must commit exact producer pins against a proven-compatible stack; the transport probe already runs in this repo's own CI (CloudHelloClient, F-023-evidenced candidates), so this is a recorded-manifest join, not a functional blocker |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.10.android](adoption.md#task-adopt-10-android) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [AND.02](#task-and-02), [AND.04](#task-and-04) |
| Write scope | `Mobile:app/build.gradle.kts`<br>`Mobile:app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`<br>`Mobile:app/src/main/kotlin/**`<br>`Mobile:gradle/libs.versions.toml`<br>`Mobile:gradle/locks/**`<br>`Mobile:gradle/verification-metadata.xml`<br>`Mobile:gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`<br>`Mobile:eng/policy/**`<br>`Mobile:eng/provenance/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-mobile-build-config](../shared-resources.md#res-mobile-build-config) (append) |
| Validation | Windows/Linux full build, dependency-verification metadata check, package/certificate inspection under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017); device install and App Link fixture-key tests are local opt-in, not CI gates |
| Completion evidence | Exact pinned tuple + wrapper checksums + regenerated locks; [F-023](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023) re-run showing closure holds after the identity change |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed scaffold, unreviewed: app/ is a Hello World module with applicationId io.github.arcforges.mobile (dev-prerelease id); shared/ is a Kotlin-Multiplatform module (android+desktop jvm targets) used only for a Compose Hot Reload preview per AGENTS.md, not a production target; CI already builds/signs/publishes real signed candidates (android-0.1.0-ci.14.1, [F-023](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023) closed for that candidate) which is de facto WP06 evidence |
| Notes | Must also decide the KMP shared/ preview module's fate: arch-27's module map (core/*, feature/*) has no KMP target, so shared/ stays a dev-only convenience outside the shipped app graph, never a second production plan (per WP30 §4). |

<a id="task-and-02"></a>

### AND.02 — Real Android module graph and AN01-AN25 route/state contracts

**Outcome.** The arch-27 module set (app, core/domain, core/data, core/network, core/security, core/designsystem, feature/home, feature/chat, feature/tasks, feature/library, feature/settings) exists as enforced Gradle modules with typed AN01-AN25 navigation/state contracts; features depend only on typed core ports.

| Kind / size | producer / L |
| Obligations | [WP-30.01](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.01) — full |
| Provides | android-module-boundaries; android-nav-contracts |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AND.01](#task-and-01) — renamed applicationId/namespace and pinned toolchain. *Why:* new modules must be created under the production package identity, not the Hello dev id |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.10.android](adoption.md#task-adopt-10-android) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Shared resources | [RES-mobile-build-config](../shared-resources.md#res-mobile-build-config) (exclusive) |
| Validation | Architecture/import boundary tests (no React Native/iOS/AGPL imports, no cross-module leakage) as offline static checks; targeted offline unit tests per module |
| Completion evidence | Module dependency graph report showing one-way core<-feature<-app dependencies; route ID inventory matching AN01-AN25 |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Only app/ and the KMP shared/ preview module exist today; none of the arch-27 core/* or feature/* modules exist |

<a id="task-and-03"></a>

### AND.03 — Android runtime and OS adapters (Compose, Credential Manager, Keystore wrapper, WorkManager, FCM registration, SAF/MediaStore)

**Outcome.** arm64 release / x64 emulator adapters for Compose, Credential Manager/passkey fallback, Keystore, WorkManager, FCM with non-GMS fallback, and SAF/MediaStore/FileProvider exist in core/security, core/data and core/network, with no unsafe fallback path.

| Field | Value |

| Kind / size | feature / L |
| Obligations | [WP-30.02](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.02) — full |
| Provides | android-os-adapters; android-keystore-wrapper; android-workmanager |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AND.02](#task-and-02) — core/security, core/data, core/network module shells. *Why:* adapters live inside these modules; cannot be written before the module boundary exists |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.10.android](adoption.md#task-adopt-10-android) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [AND.06](#task-and-06), [AND.07](#task-and-07), [AND.08](#task-and-08), [AND.12](#task-and-12) |
| Write scope | `Mobile:core/security/**`<br>`Mobile:core/data/**`<br>`Mobile:core/network/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-mobile-build-config](../shared-resources.md#res-mobile-build-config) (append) |
| Validation | Targeted offline unit tests for adapter contracts; install-on-real-device, permission-refusal, process-death and missing-Play-services scenarios are local opt-in under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017), not CI |
| Completion evidence | Adapter test matrix (permission refusal, process death, missing Play services, callback after account switch) with device identity recorded for local runs |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No Credential Manager/Keystore/WorkManager/FCM/SAF integration exists yet; only plain OkHttp networking in the Hello probe |
| Notes | Can proceed in parallel with AND.04 (core/network gRPC client) and AND.05 (Room, core/data) once AND.02's skeleton lands; they touch different files within shared modules so should be sequenced as short-lived parallel PRs, not serialized. |

<a id="task-and-04"></a>

### AND.04 — Published gRPC-Web contract consumption (Connect Kotlin client, binary framing, session/stream/retry adapters)

**Outcome.** core/network wraps the pinned contracts-proto/contracts-connect-client Maven artifacts behind typed session/stream/retry/exact-value adapters, explicitly selecting binary gRPC-Web.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-30.03](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.03) — full<br>[WP-30.00](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.00) — Kotlin Android foundation real package consumption |
| Provides | android-grpc-web-client |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AND.02](#task-and-02) — core/network module shell. *Why:* client wiring lives in this module<br>**contract** [CON.07](contracts.md#task-con-07) — io.github.arcforges:contracts-proto / contracts-connect-client Maven coordinates. *Why:* the generated client is the only legal way to speak the wire protocol; this is already published and pinned in gradle/libs.versions.toml (contracts=1.0.0-ci.60.1) so this is a real, already-available start input<br>**contract** [CON.11](contracts.md#task-con-11) — published ApplicationService/HistoryService/EventService Kotlin Connect clients. *Why:* the Android gRPC-Web contract layer consumes the application, history and event operations<br>**artifact** [AND.01](#task-and-01) — real, delivered outcome of AND.01 (Android production identity and stable toolchain reconciliation). *Why:* this integration exercises the real android production identity and stable toolchain reconciliation instead of a substitute, so it cannot start before that outcome exists |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.10.android](adoption.md#task-adopt-10-android) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [CLOUD.21](cloud.md#task-cloud-21) — publicly deployed Cloud host serving the generated business RPC surface. *Why:* the completion gate requires real packaged-Maven-consumer-and-service/device evidence, i.e. a live endpoint; the client code itself only needs the published Maven package to be written and unit-tested |
| Unblocks | [AND.07](#task-and-07), [AND.08](#task-and-08), [AND.09](#task-and-09), [AND.10](#task-and-10), [AND.11](#task-and-11), [AND.12](#task-and-12) |
| Write scope | `Mobile:core/network/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-mobile-build-config](../shared-resources.md#res-mobile-build-config) (append) |
| Validation | Targeted offline codec/adapter unit tests; real device/service calls against a deployed Cloud host are local opt-in evidence, not a CI gate (matches CloudHelloClient's existing pattern) |
| Completion evidence | Real packaged Maven consumer + service/device call evidence with exact hashes/versions/device identity |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed partial, unreviewed: CloudHelloClient.kt already demonstrates this exact pattern (ProtocolClient, GRPC_WEB, OkHttp transport, error-code mapping) for the single Hello RPC; needs generalizing to the full session/stream/retry surface |
| Notes | Merged duplicate integration or closure task formerly proposed as CON.97. |

<a id="task-and-05"></a>

### AND.05 — Room history, drafts, outbox and receipts

**Outcome.** Room schemas (local_schema, scope_partition, projection, draft, outbox, transfer, cursor, preferences) implement per-profile partitions with a durable, bounded, never-silently-evicted outbox; local canonical history is not evictable cache.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / L |
| Obligations | [WP-30.04](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.04) — full |
| Provides | android-room-store; android-outbox |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AND.02](#task-and-02) — core/data module shell. *Why:* Room lives in this module<br>**contract** [CON.11](contracts.md#task-con-11) — model-05-equivalent typed records for projections/receipts. *Why:* table shapes mirror the published wire records |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.10.android](adoption.md#task-adopt-10-android) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [AND.07](#task-and-07), [AND.08](#task-and-08), [AND.09](#task-and-09), [AND.10](#task-and-10), [AND.11](#task-and-11) |
| Write scope | `Mobile:core/data/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-mobile-build-config](../shared-resources.md#res-mobile-build-config) (append) |
| Validation | Offline Room migration/instrumented-on-emulator-or-device tests for crash recovery, capacity refusal and atomic outbox writes; local opt-in for real-device runs under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) |
| Completion evidence | Migration test results; outbox capacity-refusal and awaitingReconciliation replay tests; no silent eviction of draft/outbox rows |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No Room dependency or schema exists in the repo yet |
| Notes | Fully local; remote Task/AI content reconciled through this store may use named fixtures until WP31/52 per the producer matrix ("Task/AI fixture allowed only until 31+52"), but the store/journal/outbox mechanics themselves must be real now. |

<a id="task-and-06"></a>

### AND.06 — Secure per-account lifecycle: Keystore encryption, no-backup policy, purge/quarantine, deep-link validation

**Outcome.** Per-account Keystore-encrypted secret/pending-store policy, session/logout/revoke purge vs unsent-work quarantine/export, same-generation deep-link validation and current-foreground consent are implemented in core/security.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-30.05](../../work-packages/30-mobile-shared-architecture.md#rule-wp-30.05) — full |
| Provides | android-secure-lifecycle |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AND.03](#task-and-03) — Keystore/Credential Manager adapter wrapper. *Why:* per-account encryption is built on top of the raw OS adapter, not a second implementation of it |

| Validation | Offline unit tests for encryption/purge/quarantine logic; device-restore-without-key, logout-while-requests-run, deep-link-spoof and secret-scan-of-release-logs are local opt-in under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) |
| Completion evidence | Secret scan of release logs/backup showing no credential leakage; device restore and logout-while-in-flight scenario results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-and-07"></a>

### AND.07 — Foundation integration evidence: real candidate against deployed 22/23/24/25

**Outcome.** A candidate APK is built, installed clean and exercises real sign-in/hydration/upload/reconnect on a physical device against actually deployed Cloud identity/API/realtime/sync; any Task/AI fixtures still present are named and confirmed compiled out of production before WP31.

### AND.20 — Play and direct-channel signed update client

**Outcome.** arch-11 channel behavior and a notify-only signed update client are complete, consuming WP03's format/fixture keys now; channel-switch export/reinstall guidance is explicit.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-32.04](../../work-packages/32-mobile-release-and-store-gates.md#rule-wp-32.04) — full |
| Provides | android-update-channels |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.16](contracts.md#task-con-16) — android-update.v1 feed format and fixture signing keys. *Why:* already available per the producer matrix ("No production key prerequisite; WP32/WP41 consume fixture roots") |

### AND.21 — Physical device and recovery gates

**Outcome.** Full companion runs on minimum-supported and current physical-device profiles across weak/offline network, permission denial, no-GMS, key-loss/backup-restore, process kill and OS background limits; forward-rescue release with a higher versionCode is proven (Android never downgrades as routine rollback).

<a id="task-and-23"></a>

### AND.23 — Distribution acceptance

**Outcome.** The exact signed APK/AAB, manifest/hash/versionCode/certificate identity, compatible server/Contracts release and all gate receipts are archived and published through the automatic main graph; a clean-device download verifies signature/hash and exercises actual services.
