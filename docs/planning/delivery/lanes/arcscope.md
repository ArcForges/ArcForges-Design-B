## Tasks

<a id="task-scope-01"></a>

### SCOPE.01 — DataSource/SourceAdapter contract, connection profiles and lease/busy exclusivity

**Outcome.** A single adapter contract (DataSource/SourceAdapter/Connection) exists with persisted, reusable connection profiles; editing a profile never rewrites a historical session's recorded configuration; a second claimant on the same source is refused with a busy state.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-33.00](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.00) — shared adapter contract; ConnectionProfile storage/reuse; EffectiveConfigurationSnapshot immutability on profile edit; lease/busy exclusivity model ([BR-01](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-01)..[BR-06](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-06), [BR-09](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-09)) |
| Provides | scope.source-adapter-contract; scope.connection-profile |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [PLT.01](platform.md#task-plt-01) — published store abstraction with the single write path (for ArcScope's own profile/session store). *Why:* connection profiles and effective configuration snapshots are persisted data; [BR-06](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-06) requires historical sessions to be structurally immune to later profile edits, which needs the real single-writer store, not an in-memory stub, to prove durability/isolation honestly<br>**contract** [CON.91](contracts.md#task-con-91) — published Contracts records for capture/session identifiers referenced by ConnectionProfile. *Why:* the adapter contract's identifiers must be the real published shapes so downstream ArcScope projects and any future Cloud/AI consumer are wire-compatible from the start, not a locally invented shape that is rewritten later |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.03](#task-scope-03), [SCOPE.04](#task-scope-04), [SCOPE.05](#task-scope-05), [SCOPE.08](#task-scope-08), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11), [SIM.06](simulator.md#task-sim-06) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/**`<br>`ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Contract/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-arcscope-migrations](../shared-resources.md#res-arcscope-migrations) (append) |
| Validation | offline unit/integration tests only (profile-edit immutability test, exclusivity test with two claimants); no live Cloud or hardware required at this stage |
| Completion evidence | adapter-contract conformance tests, profile immutability test, exclusivity busy-state test |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: ArcScope repo (HEAD 5e68634) contains only the Hello World bootstrap (ArcForges.ArcScope.Core, ArcForges.ArcScope); none of ArcScope.Domain/.Acquisition/.Recording exist yet |
| Notes | Foundational; SCOPE.03 (network/replay adapters) and SCOPE.04 (serial/USB adapters) both implement this contract and can proceed in parallel once it lands. |

<a id="task-scope-02"></a>

### SCOPE.02 — Channel, signal, event and time model

**Outcome.** A precise time model spanning signal samples and discrete events with exact rate representation, explicit conversion between domains, and explicit recorded alignment between sources.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-33.03](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.03) — full |
| Provides | scope.time-channel-model |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.91](contracts.md#task-con-91) — published numeric/time wire types (rate, timestamp, duration) Channel/Signal/EventRecord must serialise as. *Why:* the time model's exactness/conversion guarantees are meaningless if the wire representation is invented locally and later has to be retrofitted to the real numbered wire profile |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.05](#task-scope-05), [SCOPE.06](#task-scope-06), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11), [SCOPE.12](#task-scope-12), [SCOPE.14](#task-scope-14) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Time/**`<br>`ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Channels/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/TimeModel/**` |
| Validation | offline unit tests: precision across rate domains, alignment with two sources, conversion exactness — pure math, no external environment |
| Completion evidence | precision/alignment/conversion test results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: no Channel/Signal/time types exist in the repo yet |
| Notes | Pure domain/math task with no native or Cloud dependency; runs fully in parallel with SCOPE.01 (different files, same repo) — a clean simultaneous-execution example. |

<a id="task-scope-03"></a>

### SCOPE.03 — Network and file-replay source adapters (TCP, UDP, file stream)

**Outcome.** TCP, UDP and file-stream-replay adapters work over real transports (pure managed sockets/file I/O), pass connect/disconnect/reconnect tests, and share SCOPE.01's profile and exclusivity model.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-33.00](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.00) — TCP/UDP/file-replay concrete adapters over the shared contract; real-transport connect/disconnect/reconnect tests |
| Provides | scope.adapters.network-file |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SCOPE.01](#task-scope-01) — DataSource/SourceAdapter contract and connection profile model. *Why:* concrete adapters implement the shared contract; cannot be written before it exists |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.05](#task-scope-05), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Network/**`<br>`ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/FileReplay/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/Network/**` |
| Validation | real-transport tests using.NET Socket/TcpListener/UdpClient loopback and local files — no native dependency, no emulator/CI restriction applies; proportionate under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) |
| Completion evidence | per-adapter real-transport connect/disconnect/reconnect results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: no adapters exist yet |
| Notes | This is the implementation-sequence.md §3 'must be real early' item: real serial/TCP/UDP transports must not be mocked. |

<a id="task-scope-04"></a>

### SCOPE.04 — Serial and USB instrument adapters

**Outcome.** Serial and USB adapters work over real hardware transports via the native ArcInstruments ABI, enumerate/open/transfer/cancel correctly, refuse busy/permission conflicts per Tier-1 RID, and record a hot-unplug as an explicit capture gap.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |
| Obligations | [WP-33.00](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.00) — serial/USB concrete adapters over the shared contract<br>[WP-33.90](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.90) — generic-USB-V1 body text (enumeration, explicit interface/endpoint open, control/bulk/interrupt transfers, partial writes, cancellation, driver/permission/busy refusal per Tier 1 RID; no automatic kernel-driver detach; hot unplug records an explicit capture gap) — this text sits orphaned between [WP-33](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33) §6 and §7 in the source doc with no substep id of its own; folded here since it is entirely about the serial/USB adapter, not §33.90's own verify-and-integration content<br>[WP-33](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33) orphaned 'Generic USB is V1' body text (enumeration/open/transfer/cancel/refusal per Tier-1 RID, no auto kernel-driver detach, hot-unplug=explicit gap) sitting between §6 Impacts and §7 Tests with no substep id — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | scope.adapters.serial-usb |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SCOPE.01](#task-scope-01) — DataSource/SourceAdapter contract and connection profile model. *Why:* concrete adapters implement the shared contract<br>**artifact** [NAT.13](native.md#task-nat-13) — published ArcInstrumentsNative package (arc_instruments_* ABI) — at minimum its fixture/simulated-hardware tier build. *Why:* [BR-10](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-10) confines the acquisition loop/lifecycle to C# and restricts native code to transport, device access, timestamps and primitives only; DesktopPlatform HEAD fe8476d has no arc_instruments ABI at all yet (grep for 'instrument' is empty) — this is a genuine not-yet-produced artifact, not a design gap. |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11) |
| Permitted substitutes | [SUB-scope-instruments-fixture](../substitutes.md#sub-scope-instruments-fixture) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Adapters/Instruments/**`<br>`ArcScope: src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Native/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Adapters/Instruments/**` |
| Validation | fixture/simulated-hardware unit tests at this task's own gate; real per-RID hardware acceptance deferred to SCOPE.11/[PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08) per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) (no device/hardware CI) |
| Completion evidence | enumeration/open/transfer/cancel/refusal results against fixture tier now; real-hardware receipt at SCOPE.11 |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: no serial/USB adapter code exists; [WP-13.12](../../work-packages/13-high-risk-technical-probes.md#rule-wp-13.12) producer itself not started (DesktopPlatform has no arc_instruments ABI directory) |
| Notes | This is the one [WP-33.00](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.00) sub-path that genuinely needs a WP13 native family, and only [WP-13.12](../../work-packages/13-high-risk-technical-probes.md#rule-wp-13.12) (not the whole WP13 package). It is the correct place to attach [PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08)'s per-RID USB acceptance text, which the source document places oddly (orphaned paragraph after [WP-33](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33) §6, before §7) with no substep id. |

<a id="task-scope-05"></a>

### SCOPE.05 — Acquisition pipeline: bounded loop, ring buffer, backpressure and overrun accounting

**Outcome.** A bounded, timestamped acquisition loop with explicit backpressure sustains throughput above the product target with bounded memory; every overrun is counted, timestamped and recorded; hardware timestamps are preserved where available and the timing source/uncertainty is recorded otherwise.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / L |
| Obligations | [WP-33.01](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.01) — full |
| Provides | scope.acquisition-pipeline; scope.rolling-buffer |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SCOPE.01](#task-scope-01) — source adapter contract. *Why:* the loop consumes adapters through the shared contract, not a concrete adapter type<br>**artifact** [SCOPE.02](#task-scope-02) — time/channel model. *Why:* timestamping and rate/conversion semantics are the time model's types; the loop cannot record exact timestamps against an undefined model<br>**artifact** [SCOPE.03](#task-scope-03) — at least one real concrete adapter (network) to drive throughput/overrun tests. *Why:* sustained-throughput and induced-overrun acceptance need a real transport; TCP/UDP is the cheapest real one and must be real early regardless, so it is the natural throughput-test source rather than waiting for serial/USB |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.06](#task-scope-06), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11), [SCOPE.13](#task-scope-13) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Acquisition/Pipeline/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Throughput/**` |
| Validation | sustained-throughput runs with recorded rate/memory/drop counts; induced overrun; timing-source assertions — local, offline, repeatable |
| Completion evidence | throughput/memory/overrun/timing-source results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | [WP-13.02](../../work-packages/13-high-risk-technical-probes.md#rule-wp-13.02) ('Probe C: high-throughput acquisition', the native and runtime-proof lanes/WP13) is a near-identical early risk proof of the same ring-buffer/throughput/overrun approach, done earlier and cheaper. It validates the approach but ships no reusable package ([BR-10](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-10) keeps the real loop in C# here regardless) — treated as an informative precedent, not a start edge. |

<a id="task-scope-06"></a>

### SCOPE.06 — Session and capture lifecycle: segments, gaps and live observation

**Outcome.** The session/capture lifecycle (armed, running, paused, stopped, finalised, interrupted) is correct; captures are sequences of segments plus explicit gaps; pausing the view never stops recording; a disconnect produces an explicit gap rather than a truncated capture.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / L |
| Obligations | [WP-33.02](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.02) — full |
| Provides | scope.session-capture-lifecycle |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SCOPE.05](#task-scope-05) — acquisition pipeline and rolling buffer. *Why:* live observation reads the rolling buffer; record capture consumes the same pipeline output<br>**artifact** [SCOPE.02](#task-scope-02) — time/channel model. *Why:* segments and gaps are time-model objects |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.07](#task-scope-07), [SCOPE.09](#task-scope-09), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11), [SCOPE.12](#task-scope-12), [SCOPE.13](#task-scope-13), [SCOPE.14](#task-scope-14), [SCOPE.15](#task-scope-15), [SCOPE.17](#task-scope-17), [SCOPE.20](#task-scope-20), [SCOPE.22](#task-scope-22) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Session/**`<br>`ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Domain/Capture/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/Lifecycle/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-arcscope-migrations](../shared-resources.md#res-arcscope-migrations) (append) |
| Validation | lifecycle coverage including interruption; pause-view-while-recording test; segment/gap integrity after disconnect — offline |
| Completion evidence | lifecycle, pause-view and gap-integrity results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-scope-07"></a>

### SCOPE.07 — Durable capture writer, chunked verifiable store and crash recovery

**Outcome.** Raw capture is written to the chunked verifiable store with per-chunk checksums and an explicit end marker; a finalised capture is structurally immutable; a crash mid-capture recovers to the last committed boundary with an honest end marker and recorded loss.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / L |
| Obligations | [WP-33.04](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33.04) — full |
| Provides | scope.durable-capture-store |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SCOPE.06](#task-scope-06) — session/capture lifecycle types. *Why:* the writer persists Capture/CaptureSegment objects defined there<br>**artifact** [PLT.06](platform.md#task-plt-06) — published chunked/large-append verifiable store primitive. *Why:* [BR-11](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-11) forbids database blobs for raw capture; this is a real evidence-integrity requirement (immutability, per-chunk checksum, crash-boundary recovery) that a hand-rolled substitute would not honestly prove — the substitute rules treat evidence-integrity storage as a case where a substitute is not acceptable |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.05.arcscope](adoption.md#task-adopt-05-arcscope) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [SCOPE.08](#task-scope-08), [SCOPE.11](#task-scope-11), [SCOPE.23](#task-scope-23), [SCOPE.24](#task-scope-24), [SCOPE.25](#task-scope-25) |
| Write scope | `ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Recording/**`<br>`ArcScope:src/ArcScope/ArcScope.Infrastructure/CaptureStore/**`<br>`ArcScope:tests/ArcScopePipelineTests/DurableCapture/**` |
| Validation | kill-during-capture at chunk boundaries and mid-chunk; recovered-prefix verification; immutability test — offline, deterministic fault injection, no live environment needed |
| Completion evidence | crash-recovery prefix verification and immutability results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | [WP-07.05](../../work-packages/07-local-persistence-foundation.md#rule-wp-07.05) is named precisely (not 'whole WP07') because [WP-07.00](../../work-packages/07-local-persistence-foundation.md#rule-wp-07.00)/.03 (store abstraction, migrations) are consumed earlier by SCOPE.01/06 for ordinary relational state, while raw capture specifically needs the large-append/chunked primitive. |

<a id="task-scope-08"></a>

### SCOPE.08 — Replay as a source (capture-level)

**Outcome.** Replay of a recorded, finalised capture feeds the same pipeline as a labelled ReplaySource, always recording its origin, and never presents device-only fields as measured.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |
| Kind / size | feature / M |

### SCOPE.09 — Long-running capture in the shell

**Outcome.** Recording state is permanently visible; closing a window during capture always asks with consequences stated, never silently stopping or continuing; background capture persists only while genuine work is active.

### SCOPE.10 — Reference drift check against Serial-Studio 639daafb

**Outcome.** A drift report exists comparing the reference against the bound commit, covering changed rows, newly introduced upstream material (mapped to an existing requirement or recorded as an accepted exclusion) and licence re-verification; every changed/new item carries a disposition.

### SCOPE.11 — Owned-artifact verification and real hardware integration

**Outcome.** The [WP-33](../../work-packages/33-arcscope-acquisition-and-session.md#rule-wp-33) candidate closes: real packaged hardware-path and throughput/overrun/recovery acceptance recorded, no automatic upload of raw acquisition data, [PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08) and [PG-03](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-03) evidence recorded for every producer this package owns.

### SCOPE.12 — Visualisation: virtualised rendering, downsampling, cursors and markers

**Outcome.** Time-series and event visualisation meets the responsiveness budget at corpus scale with virtualised rendering and downsampling; the display explicitly discloses when it is downsampled; cursor readings are exact regardless of display resolution.

Checked 12-native-interop-and-media.md (the ArcScope native-interop authority, §8) directly: zero mentions of Graphics; its native surface is device/transport/high-rate acquisition primitives only. The Graphics native family's real consumer is ArcSlate (per the native and runtime-proof lanes' own contracts note: 'used by ArcSlate mainly'). ArcScope already carries Avalonia (Skia-based managed rendering, see ArcScope third-party/Avalonia.LICENSE.txt), which is sufficient for plotting/downsampling in pure C#. |

### SCOPE.13 — Triggers with pre/post windows

### SCOPE.15 — Decoder framework and first-party protocol decoders

**Outcome.** A versioned decoder framework produces structured events (never raw channel data); malformed frames, checksum failures and unknown fields are surfaced with counts/locations; no decoder has a device-write path.

| Notes | Independent of SCOPE.14 (measurements); the two can proceed in parallel. Decoder scope (UART/I2C/SPI) is fixed by the already-frozen analysis.v1 profile in architecture doc 26-product-behavior-profiles.md — note this is the ARCHITECTURE document numbered 26, unrelated to [WP-26](../../work-packages/26-remote-action-and-tool-bridge.md#rule-wp-26) (Remote action and tool bridge); no start edge needed since the design is already frozen, not missing. |

<a id="task-scope-16"></a>

### SCOPE.16 — Analysis definitions and recipes as native ProductJobs

**Outcome.** Versioned analysis definitions compose into recipes; results are derived data reconstructable from evidence plus configuration; long analyses run as long-running product jobs with progress and cancellation; deleting and rebuilding all results matches the profile oracle within tolerance; historical results record their definition version.

| Notes | 'Native ProductJobs' reads as ArcScope's own in-process long-running Task/CancellationToken job pattern ('under their product owner'), not a shared cross-repo service; DesktopPlatform already carries a BuildingBlocks ArcForges.Application.Abstractions package this can reuse. Not modelled as a hard external artifact edge — checked [WP-08](../../work-packages/08-local-ipc-and-registration.md#rule-wp-08) specifically and ruled it out: [WP-08](../../work-packages/08-local-ipc-and-registration.md#rule-wp-08) is local IPC/process registration, not a job-execution abstraction. |

<a id="task-scope-17"></a>

### SCOPE.17 — Annotations, findings and session/capture comparison

**Outcome.** Annotations and findings exist as authored content with identity and history, never written into raw capture; session-to-session and capture-to-capture comparison states its alignment explicitly.

### SCOPE.19 — Owned-artifact verification and real integration

**Outcome.** The [WP-34](../../work-packages/34-arcscope-analysis-and-reporting.md#rule-wp-34) candidate closes: scope.measurement.v1 independent expected results, invalid/status cases and reporting references pass; native acceleration does not redefine the result; [PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08) hardware-based measurement/analysis evidence is recorded.

### SCOPE.20 — ArcChat capability surface for ArcScope

**Outcome.** Query, analysis, authoring and operational capabilities are declared, each with risk level, permission requirement and approval posture; start/stop capture are treated as real-side-effect operations, not read-only conveniences.

### SCOPE.21 — Bounded context provision for AI

**Outcome.** ArcScope contributes structured results (measurements, analysis outputs, decoded event summaries, selected ranges) as bounded context; raw capture structurally cannot enter a context payload; oversized context is refused explicitly.

### SCOPE.22 — Cloud sync scope (metadata, not raw capture)

**Outcome.** The ArcScope sync scope excludes raw capture by default and includes metadata, analysis, annotations, findings, reports and configurations; enabling project sync transfers no raw capture bytes; the policy is visible per project and per session; the included scope converges across devices.

| Field | Value |

<a id="task-scope-23"></a>

### SCOPE.23 — Explicit per-session raw capture upload

**Outcome.** Raw upload is an explicit per-session act with size/destination/consequence stated, using the chunked upload path with resumption and verification; no automatic trigger path exists anywhere (not from AI, not from enabling sync).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |

<a id="task-scope-24"></a>

### SCOPE.24 — Import, export and format fixtures

**Outcome.** Native full-fidelity bundle export/import round-trips with equivalence; tabular export carries explicit precision warnings; import enters the unified session model with a recorded origin (never disguised as a live device); every claimed import version has a fixture — satisfying [PG-07](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-07) for ArcScope.

| Notes | This task also carries the bundle-side half of [WP-51](../../work-packages/51-arcscope-cloud-simulator.md#rule-wp-51)'s 'simulator provenance separately' requirement — SIM.06 (ArcScope-side simulator ingestion) depends on this task so simulated captures round-trip through the same bundle format with their synthetic labelling intact. |

### SCOPE.25 — Extension boundary: no third-party raw-capture write path

**Outcome.** No extension-reachable path can write raw capture; extension access to ArcScope is through capabilities with owner-side validation only.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | ArcScope (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\ArcScope`); integration owner: ArcScope integration owner |

### SCOPE.26 — Owned-artifact verification and real integration

**Outcome.** The [WP-35](../../work-packages/35-arcscope-integration-and-sync.md#rule-wp-35) candidate closes: metadata sync and explicit-upload behavior remain distinct; context/report data retain measurement identity and ownership across real service calls; [PG-03](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-03) licence/provenance evidence recorded.

### SCOPE.27 — Real ArcScope metadata sync against the deployed Cloud sync engine

**Outcome.** ArcScope session and capture metadata sync scopes converge across devices against the deployed Cloud sync engine, replacing the contract-bound sync substitute; raw captures stay local unless explicitly uploaded.
