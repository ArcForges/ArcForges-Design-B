## Tasks

<a id="task-ast-01"></a>

### AST.01 — Single application history store (model 05 schema)

**Outcome.** Assistant.Persistence.Sqlite implements the full data-model-05 schema (assistant_conversation/branch/message/draft/turn/receipt/outbox/history_import/attachment/project/conversation_project/profile/skill/context/task_projection/compaction), migrations and typed payloads, plus Android logical-schema fixtures. Competing model-02 conversation tables retired.

| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Validation | Offline unit tests: DDL with foreign keys, migrations, disk-full, branch fork, concurrent-window stale revision, duplicate terminal frame, interrupted send; no live environment. |
| Completion evidence | Schema/migration hash, transaction-kill and disk-full test results, one-store-per-application-profile proof. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No Assistant.Core or Assistant.Persistence.Sqlite project exists in DesktopPlatform yet. |
| Notes | Foundation for all other WP15 substeps and for WP16/17's reuse of conversation identities; a schema mistake here invalidates branches, attachments, projects, skills, search and export simultaneously, so it should land and stabilize early. |

<a id="task-ast-02"></a>

### AST.02 — Branches and window drafts

**Outcome.** Immutable ancestry and fork-at-message; per-window draft revisions with a shared committed service within one application. Concurrent windows, draft preserved during another send, parent/child isolation proven.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-ast-03"></a>

### AST.03 — Attachments and provenance

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-ast-04"></a>

### AST.04 — Projects and profiles

**Outcome.** Accepted project/instruction/profile CRUD, validation, immutable per-execution snapshots and application partitioning; conflict/revision handling and profile change cannot alter an active execution.

| Completion evidence | Immutable-snapshot-during-active-execution test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-ast-05"></a>

### AST.05 — Skills

**Outcome.** Accepted skill/version/permission metadata and selection, without installing an external agent or granting authority from content; untrusted instructions remain content, cross-app source denied.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-ast-06"></a>

### AST.06 — Local search

**Outcome.** Indexes only committed non-deleted normal history in the owning partition, with exact citations/branches and a rebuildable index; delete/rebuild, partial index and no temporary/other-app leak proven.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |

| Provides | assistant-local-search |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AST.01](#task-ast-01) — the real committed-message store to index. *Why:* search must index the real committed content, not a fixture, to prove no temporary/other-app leak |

<a id="task-ast-07"></a>

### AST.07 — Local history export and import (assistant-history.v1)

**Outcome.** Produces/consumes assistant-history.v1 from committed local snapshots, preserving branch/message/resource provenance and missing-resource reports; import remaps identities. Complete offline without Cloud, implicit upload or mode conversion. Cloud promotion itself remains [WP-25](../../work-packages/25-sync-engine-and-blob-lifecycle.md#rule-wp-25).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |

| Provides | assistant-history-export-format |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [AST.01](#task-ast-01) — the real committed history store to export from. *Why:* offline round-trip must exercise the real store's branch graph<br>**contract** [CON.11](contracts.md#task-con-11) — published assistant-history.v1 format definition. *Why:* export/import implements the published format, not a private one |

| Completion evidence | Round-trip hash manifests, malformed/cycle/cancel test results, named-fixture manifest entry for this substitute. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | One of the four named scaffolding rows in implementation-sequence.md §3.1 (shared with ArcNotes' own [WP-19.05](../../work-packages/19-arcnotes-search-and-portability.md#rule-wp-19.05), not mine). See integration_proposals IM.history-export-cloud-promotion. |

<a id="task-ast-08"></a>

### AST.08 — Reference and package proof (AionUi evidence, clean-app package consumption)

**Outcome.** AionUi component evidence/provenance recorded; the actual candidate Assistant.Core/Assistant.Persistence.Sqlite package consumed from a clean test application with no reference runtime or imported agent scope.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / S |

| Completion evidence | Package hash manifest, AionUi reference-coverage citation (arcchat-aionui.md, no reused code), clean-app test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: arcchat-aionui.md reference matrix already exists (bound to commit 29c9271a5) with zero reuse rows; this task re-checks for drift, does not recreate the matrix. |

<a id="task-ast-09"></a>

### AST.09 — Owned-artifact receipt and UX acceptance

**Outcome.** WP15 built/packed once from a clean environment; all applicable UX acceptance groups recorded; package/contract/owner/version compatibility and failure/recovery evidence attached; no later-provider fixture closes a real WP15 gate.

<a id="task-ast-10"></a>

### AST.10 — Complete assistant navigation shell

**Outcome.** All AS01 to AS13 docked/floating/expanded surfaces are reachable through the architecture-27 AssistantHost API; the same composition code works independently in each product. All actions reachable at minimum size; window/draft/account/keyboard/accessibility matrix passes.

### AST.11 — Cloud client and device runtime (fixture turn endpoint boundary)

**Outcome.** Reusable Cloud.Client (session/event/output/upload) and Device.Runtime (own-app registration/presence, pull/claim/result, typed dispatch adapter) implemented against generated gRPC-Web contracts; own-app typed dispatch adapters work end-to-end in-process. Named future-owner fixtures stand in for [WP-23](../../work-packages/23-public-api-and-generated-clients.md#rule-wp-23) through [WP-26](../../work-packages/26-remote-action-and-tool-bridge.md#rule-wp-26) and [WP-52](../../work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52) until those exist.
