## Tasks

<a id="task-com-01"></a>

### COM.01 — Provider adapter boundary

**Outcome.** A provider-agnostic adapter boundary exists in Billing with a typed capability description; no provider type/identifier/webhook shape appears outside it, enforced by an architecture test.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / S |
| Obligations | [WP-42.00](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.00) — full |

| Validation | Offline architecture test (dependency-direction scan) + unit tests under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017); no live provider network calls in CI. |
| Completion evidence | Architecture-test pass log naming the forbidden-leakage scan; capability-driven behavior test results for at least one absent capability. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo at HEAD ce0a32a4 has no Billing module; only Hello World host (src/ArcForges.Cloud) and CF worker bootstrap exist. |

<a id="task-com-02"></a>

### COM.02 — Catalogue and versioned policy

**Outcome.** Offers, prices and policy versions exist as effective-dated policy data with no commercial figure compiled into code, and historical orders are immune to later price changes.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |

| Completion evidence | Retroactivity negative test result; compiled-constant scan result (zero hits). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No Catalog module present at Cloud HEAD ce0a32a4. |

<a id="task-com-03"></a>

### COM.03 — Purchase pipeline

**Outcome.** Purchase intent is the idempotency anchor for hosted checkout; one intent yields at most one order, a forged redirect grants nothing, and every checkout attempt carries complete internal metadata with no payment-instrument field anywhere in ArcForges.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / L |
| Obligations | [WP-42.02](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.02) — full |
| Provides | purchase-intent; checkout-attempt; order-confirming-state |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [COM.01](#task-com-01) — provider adapter's hosted-checkout port and capability description. *Why:* checkout attempts must call the provider only through the adapter boundary; without it the pipeline would embed provider shapes directly, violating [BR-13](../../work-packages/22-identity-workspace-and-device.md#rule-br-13)<br>**artifact** [COM.02](#task-com-02) — Offer/Price/PriceVersion read model. *Why:* a purchase intent must reference a priced offer at a specific policy version to be idempotent and non-retroactive<br>**artifact** [CLOUD.24](cloud.md#task-cloud-24) — public API idempotency-key/rate-limiting primitive. *Why:* purchase intent double-submission handling is expected to reuse the platform's general idempotency mechanism rather than reinvent one per endpoint; exact API shape not yet observed since [WP-23](../../work-packages/23-public-api-and-generated-clients.md#rule-wp-23) is not yet built |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07](adoption.md#task-adopt-07) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Shared resources | [RES-contract-consumer-pins](../shared-resources.md#res-contract-consumer-pins) (append) |
| Validation | Offline unit/integration tests: double-submission, redirect-forgery negative, metadata-completeness, expired-attempt reconciliation; no live Paddle calls in CI (sandbox calls stay in manual/scheduled acceptance per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)). |
| Completion evidence | Double-submission test producing exactly one order; redirect-forgery negative result; metadata-completeness assertion. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-com-04"></a>

### COM.04 — Provider event inbox

**Outcome.** Every provider event is persisted before processing, signature-verified, deduplicated, and processed through the fixed eight-step verification chain, with quarantine and alerting for unprocessable events and idempotent full-inbox replay.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / L · early risk proof |
| Obligations | [WP-42.03](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.03) — full |
| Provides | provider-event-inbox; event-verification-chain |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [COM.01](#task-com-01) — adapter signature-verification capability and typed event shape. *Why:* the inbox must verify signatures and interpret event types only through the adapter ([BR-13](../../work-packages/22-identity-workspace-and-device.md#rule-br-13)); it cannot parse provider payloads itself<br>**artifact** [COM.03](#task-com-03) — CheckoutAttempt/Order identifiers to correlate events against. *Why:* out-of-order handling and idempotency by event type+identifier require the purchase-side identifiers the event correlates to |

| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [COM.09](#task-com-09), [COM.11](#task-com-11), [COM.14](#task-com-14) |
| Permitted substitutes | [SUB-provider-event-fixtures](../substitutes.md#sub-provider-event-fixtures) |

| Validation | Offline unit tests: duplicate, out-of-order, unsigned, unknown-product, replay, backlog-alert, convergence-from-point-in-time; deterministic fixture replay only, no live provider calls. |
| Completion evidence | Convergence test reproducing identical commercial state from inbox replay; backlog alert firing test. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Webhook idempotency/ordering/signature correctness is named by [SQ-08](../../implementation-sequence.md#rule-sq-08) as one of the two things that must be real before pricing is published; get this right before building ledgers/reconciliation on top. |

<a id="task-com-05"></a>

### COM.05 — Entitlement resolver

**Outcome.** Immutable grants and revocations resolve deterministically into an entitlement snapshot with a per-capability reason and version, and rebuilding the snapshot from its grants/revocations always reproduces the stored snapshot.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / L · early risk proof |
| Obligations | [WP-42.04](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.04) — full |

| Write scope | `Cloud:src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Entitlement/**/Resolver/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-cloud-host-composition](../shared-resources.md#res-cloud-host-composition) (append) |
| Validation | Offline unit tests: rebuild-equivalence over fixture accounts, reason-coverage, combination matrix over the four entitlement kinds, clock-determinism against an injected time source. |
| Completion evidence | Rebuild-equivalence test result (snapshot-from-scratch equals stored snapshot) across fixture accounts. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | [BR-06](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-06) rebuild-equivalence is the core commerce invariant; COM.06/07/08/10/12 all read this resolver's snapshot, so its correctness gates a large share of downstream work. |

<a id="task-com-06"></a>

### COM.06 — Distribution and enforcement

**Outcome.** Entitlement is distributed with its version for client caching, realtime notification is only a refresh hint, offline staleness is bounded, all cost-bearing enforcement happens server-side, and losing entitlement never deletes local data.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |

| Validation | Offline tests: hint-not-authority, offline-staleness behavior, client-bypass negative, local-data-survival. |
| Completion evidence | Client-bypass negative test result; local-data-survival result. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-com-07"></a>

### COM.07 — Quota, usage and storage accounting

**Outcome.** Quota (limit) and usage (measurement) live in separate stores keyed to the entitlement period, storage accounting matches committed objects exactly, and an exceeded quota produces a typed, explained refusal.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / L |
| Obligations | [WP-42.06](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.06) — full |
| Provides | quota-usage-storage-accounting |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [CLOUD.07](cloud.md#task-cloud-07) — the published capacity/quota kernel (Capacity and Container/D1 integration producer). *Why:* [WP-42.06](../../work-packages/42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42.06) text explicitly requires consuming the [WP-21.06](../../work-packages/21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21.06) quota kernel rather than reimplementing gauge/reservation admission<br>**artifact** [COM.05](#task-com-05) — versioned entitlement grants. *Why:* quota resolution must apply new versioned grants without resetting gauges or outstanding reservations, which requires the resolver's version field |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07](adoption.md#task-adopt-07) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Shared resources | [RES-cloud-host-composition](../shared-resources.md#res-cloud-host-composition) (append) |
| Validation | Offline tests: race admissions, quota downgrade, repeated cancellation, GC timeout, period rollover with held old-period use, boundary-reset, accounting-vs-committed-storage comparison, refusal-message. |
| Completion evidence | Accounting comparison result against actual committed storage; boundary-reset test result. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-com-08"></a>

### COM.08 — Credits

**Outcome.** Purchased (no-expiry) and compensation (disclosed-expiry) credit lots exist in integer micro-credits with funding order capacity to compensation to purchased, single-reservation-spans-both-pools accounting, reservation-expiry sweeping and a hard stop at zero with no floating point anywhere in the path.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Completion evidence | Concurrency test showing no overdraft under concurrent reservation; fixed-precision scan result. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-com-09"></a>

### COM.09 — Ledgers and reconciliation

**Outcome.** The three ledgers exist as separate append-only stores with scheduled two-way provider reconciliation expressing repairs as new typed records, never edits, and divergence above threshold alerts.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |

<a id="task-com-10"></a>

### COM.10 — Refunds, disputes and evidence

**Outcome.** A refund verifiably rolls entitlement back, dispute records are tracked, and a commercial evidence export covering order/payment/event/entitlement-history/usage for a period is complete, reproducible and free of payment-instrument data.

<a id="task-com-11"></a>

### COM.11 — Service term interval model

**Outcome.** entitlement.service_term exists as an interval keyed on (kind, period_ref) with subscription_ref stable across renewals, a renewal always creating a new period_ref row, a replayed provider event extending nothing twice, and a plan change superseding rather than editing.

| Field | Value |

### COM.12 — Replenishing capacity bucket, refill and admission

**Outcome.** The capacity bucket refills by a per-period saturating accrual independent of evaluation frequency, backed by a monotonic durable watermark and exact rational carry, never claws back on a ceiling reduction, initialises exactly once per contiguous run, and admission is atomic with the service-term check first, committing before dispatch.

### COM.13 — Operator financial-owner proposal/approval operations

**Outcome.** The financial-owner operator RPCs (grant/revokeGrant/issueCredit/adjustCredit/refund) are implemented exactly once against the registry04 §9 typed proposal/approval protocol with all eight authorization fields, refusing public customer/PAT/agent access, and one approved proposal cannot execute twice.
