## Tasks

<a id="task-con-01"></a>

### CON.01 — Shard contended eng inventory/constraint files by domain; fix one-owner merge protocol

**Outcome.** public/proto/constraints.json and internal/proto/constraints.json are split into small per-domain shard files (mirroring the already-proven fixtures/public/wp03-NN.json pattern) merged by eng/contracts.py; eng/contract-packages.json and eng/foundation-inventory.json gain a documented append protocol; a short CONTRIBUTING note fixes the single Contracts integration owner who serially merges CON.* branches.

| Validation | offline: eng/contracts.py generate --check round-trips the sharded constraints back to the same effective merged content; existing eng/check_foundation.py and check_serialization.py pass unchanged. |
| Completion evidence | eng/contracts.py generate --check clean; diff shows only file-layout change, zero constraint-content change. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: public/proto/constraints.json is a single 3070-line file today (confirmed by direct read), alphabetically ordered by fully-qualified message name; internal/proto/constraints.json is a single 107-line file. No sharding exists yet. |
| Notes | Optional enabler: without it, closure pull requests edit the same constraint files and are merged one at a time with rebase-and-regenerate by the Contracts integration owner, which remains the fallback protocol. |

### CON.02 — Capability/action/context/version/health descriptor records + immutable oversized-body reference (EncodedBodyRef)

**Outcome.** CapabilityDescriptor, ActionDescriptor, ContextProvider/ContextDescriptor, CompatibilityDescriptor/ContractVersion/FeatureSet and HealthSnapshot/InstancePresence/InstanceHealth/InstanceReadiness records (architecture 02-contracts-and-protocols.md §4/5/6/11/12 domain model) are generated in Foundation or PublicApi as appropriate, plus EncodedBodyRef (registry04 §4) wired into every ResponseMeta.value oneof tag-4 read projection; independent positive/negative fixtures cover descriptor shape and the >4MiB large-read-projection envelope (messageType/descriptorHash/byteLength/snapshotToken/ResourceVersionRef SHA256 check before decode).

| Obligations | [WP-03.03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.03) — capability/action/context/version/health descriptor records only, plus EncodedBodyRef (the immutable oversized-body reference form); excludes the Sync mutation allowlist and cross-owner/wrong-revision/opaque-object/forbidden-path negative vectors, which are CON.03 |
| Provides | capability-action-context-descriptors; encoded-body-ref |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.91](#task-con-91) — published Foundation ResourceRef/ResourceVersionRef/ArtifactRef (already generated) as the base EncodedBodyRef.resource field type. *Why:* EncodedBodyRef's resource field is a ResourceVersionRef; without the already-published Foundation closure this can't compile. |

| Validation | offline unit tests for descriptor round-trip (C#/TS), decode-limit fixtures (exact 64MiB boundary and 64MiB+1 refusal) reusing WP03.02's WireLimits constants, deterministic regeneration, generated-header/import checks; no macOS/device/live-service CI per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017). |
| Completion evidence | Independent fixture file con-02-descriptors.json; C#/TS conformance report; descriptor baseline diff. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Grepped the whole repo for CapabilityDescriptor/ActionDescriptor/ContextDescriptor/HealthSnapshot/InstancePresence/InstanceHealth/InstanceReadiness/CompatibilityDescriptor/EncodedBodyRef/ApplicationPresence: zero matches anywhere. None of these types exist in any form. |
| Notes | This is the 'descriptor' half of [WP-03.03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.03). Small and foundational: many later domain tasks (CON.06 in-process ports, CON.10 task/chat tool binding) reference CapabilityDescriptor for tool metadata, so this should land early even though nothing strictly blocks it from running in parallel with CON.03-CON.05. |

### CON.03 — Resource/Sync owner-body admission: closed Sync mutation allowlist + cross-owner/wrong-revision/opaque-object/forbidden-path negatives

**Outcome.** A generated/schema-derived validator enforces that Sync (registry04 §10) accepts client-origin writes only for NotebookBody/NotesDocument/PropertyDefinition/SavedViewRecord/TagRecord and authorized ScopeMetadata/SlateMetadata (AggregateBody's Cloud-writable subset), refusing TaskSnapshot/AutomationView/ConversationBody/AgentProfile/SkillRecord/ChatProjectRecord/MemoryRecord/PreferenceRecord as client writes (Cloud-authored-only); externalBody indirection resolves to the same allowlist before validation. Independent negative vectors cover cross-owner reference, wrong-revision precondition, opaque/unknown AggregateBody variant, and forbidden-path (non-allowlisted body kind) attempts, plus compatible unknown-response preservation.

| Kind / size | contract / M |
| Obligations | [WP-03.03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.03) — the Sync mutation allowlist and oversized-body admission negative-vector half; ResourceRef/ResourceVersionRef/BlobRef schema itself is already done (CON.91/[WP-03.01](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.01)) |
| Provides | sync-mutation-allowlist; owner-body-admission-negatives |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.02](#task-con-02) — EncodedBodyRef record. *Why:* the 'immutable oversized-body reference form' [WP-03.03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.03) asks for is EncodedBodyRef; the admission validator must recognize it as the alternative to an inline AggregateBody. |

| Validation | offline positive/negative fixture suite (C#/TS); schema-level validator only (no owner authorization, persistence or transaction — those stay with [WP-07](../../work-packages/07-local-persistence-foundation.md#rule-wp-07)/[WP-21](../../work-packages/21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21) per CA rules). |
| Completion evidence | fixtures/public/con-03-sync-allowlist.json with named negative cases; validator unit test report. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed partial, unreviewed: The underlying AggregateBody oneof (all 16 branches) and every named record it references already exist and are published (WP03.01). Only the ADMISSION RULE (which branches Sync may accept as a client write) and its negative vectors are missing — confirmed by grepping content.proto for SyncScope/SyncChange/ChangeProposal/ChangeReceipt/AggregateView/ConflictView/BootstrapManifest: none exist yet either (those are CON.09's job, registry04 §5 Sync service operations, not this validator). |
| Notes | Deliberately scoped narrower than 'author SyncService.* RPC methods' (that's CON.09, part of the huge [WP-03.05](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.05) business-operation registry). CON.03 is only the shared-record ADMISSION RULE that CON.09's SyncService.pushChange/pushBatch and [WP-21](../../work-packages/21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21)'s real D1 sync both must obey — keeping it separate lets [WP-21](../../work-packages/21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21) pin an early closure (CON.03) without waiting for the full SyncService RPC surface (CON.09). |

### CON.04 — ContentSandbox service schema (24 methods: session/slot/media/image/PDF/OTIO)

**Outcome.** internal/proto/arcforges/local/sandbox/v1/sandbox.proto has the complete ContentSandboxService with all 24 methods, generated into ArcForges.Contracts.LocalRpc.Sandbox; wrong-child-direction/removed-method/cross-product-registration negative fixtures pass; policy test asserts every method carries the generated service/descriptor identity (CA rule).

| Validation | offline: wrong-direction/removed-method/parent-death/cross-product-registration negative fixtures (per annex09 §6 required test list); policy test for generated service/descriptor identity; no real helper process, no live parser (that is [WP-11](../../work-packages/11-security-foundation.md#rule-wp-11)/[WP-13](../../work-packages/13-high-risk-technical-probes.md#rule-wp-13)). |
| Completion evidence | fixtures/internal/con-04-content-sandbox.json; RPC policy test report. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed scaffold, unreviewed: SandboxLimits (7-field record) already exists as a WP03.00 seed slice. No ContentSandboxService and none of its 24 methods exist (confirmed: grep '^service ' finds only HelloService and ExtensionHostService anywhere in the repo). |
| Notes | The single biggest service in the whole registry (24 methods). Independently implementable in parallel with CON.05/CON.06 — different proto file (sandbox/v1 vs platform/v1), different owning package (.LocalRpc.Sandbox vs.LocalRpc.Platform/.Chat/.Notes/.Scope/.Slate). |

<a id="task-con-05"></a>

### CON.05 — Extension/Connector/LocalBootstrap service schema (annex09 helper closure minus ContentSandbox)

**Outcome.** Public ExtensionHostService gains Handshake/Invoke/Stop (Handshake already partially scoped by extensions.proto's ExtensionLease); internal LocalBootstrapService (platform/v1) and ConnectorBroker are generated with the exact bootstrap transcript (HMAC-SHA256 challenge/confirm, one-use 32-byte secret) and connector state machine from annex09 §§2,6; IHubRegistry/IHubRouting/DeviceSsoBrokerService names are reserved in a retirement manifest and asserted absent from active service registration by a structural test.

### CON.06 — Product in-process port completion: INotesOperations/IScopeOperations/ISlateOperations/IChatOperations + infra ports

**Outcome.** Every method in manifest11's 'in-process' scope class (ICapabilityProvider, IContextProvider, IArtifactHandler, IResourceAccess, IProductLifecycle, IDeepLinkTarget, INotesOperations [26 methods], IScopeOperations [13], ISlateOperations [19], IChatOperations [8]) is generated as a typed request/result pair per registry04 §6, with product-port packages containing only in-process records (no listener/gRPC registration) and a policy test proving that.

| Notes | Four independent product sub-surfaces (Notes/Scope/Slate/Chat) that could in principle be four separate tasks; kept as one task because they share the same infra-port dependency (ICapabilityProvider etc.) and are individually S-to-M sized — splitting further would violate the 'do not create one task per trivial item' guidance. A future re-split by product is reasonable if a product-area team wants to own its own port slice. |

### CON.07 — Identity/session/device operation registry + native-auth and browser HTTP exceptions

**Outcome.** IdentityService/WorkspaceService/DeviceService are generated with all listed operations, exact request/response field tags, and the eight authorization fields exported per operation; GET /session/v1/native/authorize, POST /session/v1/native/token and the four /session/v1 browser routes have generated strict-JSON exception schemas (reusing WP03.02's JsonSerializerContext posture); independent fixtures cover the identity journeys table in contracts07 §1 (account creation, email/passkey/OIDC login, recovery, step-up, refresh, logout, PAT).

| Provides | identity-session-device-ops; native-browser-auth-exceptions |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.02](#task-con-02) — none blocking — this domain does not depend on descriptors. *Why:* listed for completeness; identity ops use only Foundation (done) and their own new records (AuthChallenge, NativeSession, SessionView, etc. — all already scaffolded as Foundation-adjacent, need verification during implementation) |

### CON.08 — Entitlement/commerce operation registry

**Outcome.** EntitlementService/CommerceService generated with all listed operations and exact fields; every operation is tagged compatibility-class=frozen per [CC-04](../../../architecture/04-desktop-application-architecture.md#rule-cc-04); independent fixtures cover the closed condition set's entitlement.*/commerce.* error rows.

### CON.09 — Sync/resource-transfer/objects operation registry + realm-transfer.v1

**Outcome.** SyncService/ResourceService/TransferService generated with all listed operations; SyncService.pushChange/pushBatch enforce CON.03's mutation allowlist at the schema-validator boundary; realm-transfer.v1's included/excluded-roots manifest and chunked-batch (<=100 roots) semantics are schema-encoded per contracts07 §5.

| Provides | sync-resource-transfer-ops; realm-transfer-v1 |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.03](#task-con-03) — the closed Sync mutation allowlist validator. *Why:* SyncService.pushChange/pushBatch cannot be schema-complete without the admission rule that rejects non-allowlisted AggregateBody variants — generating the RPC methods without it would let a consumer invent Sync semantics, which [WP-03.03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.03)'s own completion gate explicitly forbids. |

### CON.10 — Task/approval/bridge/chat/agent/automation/search operation registry + ai-internal package

**Outcome.** All listed public services generated with exact fields and eight authorization fields; @arcforges/ai-internal and CloudInternal gain the ~15 internal/ai/v1 HTTP port schemas (authorize/claim/renew/reconcile/context/model-intent/model-outcome/settle/prepare-tools/cloud-tool/wait/finalize/stream-state/late-outcome + the inference-job family) from contracts05 §3/§8 as closed JSON records with CommitReceipt-style semantics.

<a id="task-con-11"></a>

### CON.11 — Application/history/execution/events operations (annex10's 13 additions) + EventService

**Outcome.** ApplicationService/HistoryService/ExecutionService/EventService generated with all 13+1 operations, RequestMeta.applicationScope(8)/historyMode(11) and ToolRequest.targetApplication(16) appended without renumbering existing fields; the 17 EventService.Poll hint payloads (sync.changed through config.revisionActivated) generated from one event registry; binary server-streaming frames validated at 32KiB/frame; reserved future Hub/DeviceSso methods verified absent from active registration.

### CON.12 — Extension and policy schemas: manifest.v1/workflow.v1/panel.v1/policy body.v1/configuration.v1

**Outcome.** The five contracts08 schema families are authored as closed JSON schemas (manifest.v1/workflow.v1/panel.v1 under public/http or a dedicated extensions schema path; policy body.v1 and configuration.v1 under public/http and internal/ai-http respectively) with generated C#/TS validators; independent vectors cover malformed archive, permission expansion, revoke-during-work, private-schema-rollback-refusal and the deterministic bucket-assignment hash vectors from contracts08 §5.

### CON.13 — Package catalog operation registry (CatalogService)

**Outcome.** arcforges.catalog.v1 generated with the 7 public CatalogService operations and their records; DNS TXT publisher-verification challenge format and the PAT-eligible subset (catalog.search/getPackage/listVersions/submitVersion/getSubmission per catalogue00's PAT allowlist) are schema-encoded.

### CON.14 — Operator control service (OperatorService, full §9/9.1/9.2 protocol)

**Outcome.** internal/proto/arcforges/operator/v1/operator.proto generated with all 29 OperatorService methods (ListCases through catalog.review/catalog.revoke), OperatorCallContext(tag100)/OperatorProposalRef(tag101) appended per method, and the typed propose/approve/execute protocol (§9.2) with its 9 mutation-variant table rows (grant/revokeGrant/issueCredit/adjustCredit/refund/catalogReview/catalogRevoke/appeal/kill); independent negative vectors cover distinct-approver violation, stale hash/revision/configuration, role revocation, expiry, concurrent consumption and lost receipt; no direct SQL or public-SDK import of operator schema.

### CON.15 — Cloudflare-internal HTTP bindings (AI Worker <-> C# ports beyond ai-internal's chat/task family)

**Outcome.** The remaining ~15 contracts05 internal HTTP ports and their records are generated as closed JSON schemas in internal/ai-http/v1/schema.json (or a dedicated internal/cf-http/v1 if the CON.10 file is already large), reusing WP03.02's strict-JSON posture; independent vectors cover duplicate dispatch, lease takeover, R2 part mismatch and stale-epoch rejection per contracts05 §7's injection list (schema-level only — no live Worker).

### CON.16 — Signed catalog/update/realm formats (catalog-index.v1, catalog-revocations.v1, android-update.v1, realm.v1)

**Outcome.** The four signed-format schemas are authored under public/http (or a dedicated signed-formats path) with canonical signing-vector fixtures and a deterministic fixture-only trust root (Ed25519, distinct from any production key); malformed/expired/rollback/mixed-shard negative vectors exist per [WP-03.07](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.07)'s gate; android-update.v1 matches registry04's tail-section field list exactly (packageId/channel/versionName/versionCode-as-string/minSdk/minSupportedVersionCode/apkUrl/sha256/size/signingCertificateSha256/releaseNotesUrl/publishedAt, expiry<=7 days).

### CON.17 — Cross-language compatibility window + canonical semantic hash

**Outcome.** A canonical-semantic-hash implementation (per registry04 §2's exact algorithm: sorted ASCII property names, canonical integer/decimal strings, NFC where required) exists in C#/TS with shared golden vectors; a compatibility-matrix test harness runs previous-published-client-assembly against current server and current client against a pinned minimum-server descriptor set, both directions; deliberate deletion/tag-reuse/type-change mutations are injected and must fail the baseline-diff gate before publication.

| Provides | compat-window-semantic-hash |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.92](#task-con-92) — already-published Foundation/PublicApi as the 'previous stable' fixture. *Why:* the compatibility matrix needs an actual previously-published package version to compare against; the WP03.01/03.02 published releases (1.0.0-ci.89.1 / 1.0.0-ci.92.1) already serve as that baseline, so this can start immediately. |

| Completion evidence | fixtures/public/con-17-compat-hash.json; compatibility-matrix CI job report. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No semantic-hash implementation or compatibility-matrix harness exists yet; only the basic descriptor-diff regeneration check from WP03.00/01/02 exists (a much narrower 'did anything change' check, not the full previous/current-client x current/minimum-server matrix). |
| Notes | Marked early_risk_proof=true: getting the canonical semantic hash algorithm right (vs. wire byte hash) early is exactly the kind of narrow risk proof that should stay early, because every later domain task's fixtures implicitly depend on hash determinism, and a late discovery of a hash-algorithm bug would invalidate many already-published fixture files. |

### CON.18 — Operation-scope manifest + authorization-reachability matrix generator

**Outcome.** A generator/policy-test tool reads manifest11's ~380-row scope-class table as its oracle, cross-references every currently-registered service method's exported eight authorization fields (capability/risk/approval/stepUp/localPresence/egress/patEligible/actorKinds), and fails the build on any unclassified, ambiguous, or nonexistent-idempotency-example method, or any tool reachability of a human-only approval/credential/commerce/policy method.

### CON.19 — WP03.90 — verify the owned Contracts artifact and its real (non-consumer) integration

**Outcome.** Deterministic generation, compatibility/reserved-field checks (CON.17's harness), Apache closure, and independent precise-value/error/profile vectors all pass across the complete CON.02-CON.18 closure; all three generated client ecosystems (NuGet, npm, Maven/Kotlin) restore the actual published candidate artifacts in isolated consumer tests; the [WP-03.90](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.90) completion receipt records exact artifact identities and real-vs-fixture status per obligation.

### CON.22 — Account support, notification, data, preference, policy-bundle and export-job operations

**Outcome.** Support case, notification and push registration, data export request/state, preference, policy bundle and export-job status/cancel/download operations are generated with exact fields, authorization profiles and vectors in C#, TypeScript and Kotlin.

| Kind / size | contract / M |
| Obligations | [WP-03.05](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03.05) — support.*, notification.*, data.*, preference.*, policy.getBundle and export.* operations (15), records and vectors |
| Provides | Account support, notification, data, preference, policy-bundle and export-job operations |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.02](#task-con-02) — capability/action/context/resource descriptor and oversized-body reference records. *Why:* these operations carry resource references, descriptors and immutable body references defined by the shared descriptor closure |

### CON.91 — WP03.01 — foundation contract types (accepted, historical)

**Outcome.** 148 records (32 Foundation incl. ResourceRef/ResourceVersionRef/BlobRef/ArtifactRef/ContentOrigin, 116 PublicApi incl. all 16 AggregateBody branches) generated with safe value wrappers; 476 C#/TS conformance cases pass.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | accepted — Verified in code: foundation.proto has exactly the 32 messages/3+1 enums listed in the evidence receipt (grep '^message /^enum ' confirms). content.proto has ~108 PublicApi messages including AggregateBody with all 16 branches. |
| Notes | Historical record. IMPORTANT: this substep's dependency-closure side effect already generated ResourceRef/ResourceVersionRef/BlobRef/ArtifactRef — WP03.03 does not need to invent these, only add capability/action/context/health descriptors, the Sync mutation allowlist validator, and EncodedBodyRef (still absent). |

### CON.92 — WP03.02 — serialization posture (accepted, historical)

**Outcome.** Google.Protobuf/protobuf-es are the only business serializers; decode limits (4MiB/256KiB/32KiB/64MiB), strict HTTP-exception JSON codecs, explicit service catalogues, forbidden-serializer policy gate and a test-only Native AOT probe (13 libraries, Linux CI + Windows local) all pass.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | accepted — Verified: this is exactly current Contracts HEAD. git log --all and gh pr list --state all (up to PR#37) both stop here; no PR38+ exists anywhere, local or remote. |
| Notes | This is Contracts' current HEAD. Every task below starts from this baseline. Both the Contracts repo's own docs/wp03-02-serialization.md and Design's evidence doc independently state '03.03 is next and has not started' — and no artifact anywhere (git log --all, all.worktree dirs, gh pr list --state all, fixtures/ directory contents, proto message/service inventory) contradicts that. See report.md §Q1 for the full evidence chain. |
