## Tasks

<a id="task-exe-01"></a>

### EXE.01 — Execution chain and its persistence (ProductJob engine core)

**Outcome.** The full ProductJob/JobStep/JobAttempt chain with distinct types and lifecycles, persisted durably at every state transition; invalid transitions rejected; state survives process termination.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / L · early risk proof |

Bound to the wire registry, [TK-05](../../../architecture/contracts/01-public-api-operations.md#rule-tk-05) and task.tool_result -- the same key [WP-26.03](../../work-packages/26-remote-action-and-tool-bridge.md#rule-wp-26.03) uses. — package-level obligation contribution |

| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [AST.10](assistant.md#task-ast-10), [AST.13](assistant.md#task-ast-13), [DEV.05](device-bridge.md#task-dev-05), [EXE.02](#task-exe-02), [EXE.03](#task-exe-03), [EXE.04](#task-exe-04), [EXE.05](#task-exe-05), [EXE.06](#task-exe-06), [EXE.07](#task-exe-07), [EXE.08](#task-exe-08), [EXE.09](#task-exe-09), [SLATE.28](arcslate.md#task-slate-28), [SLATE.30](arcslate.md#task-slate-30) |

| Validation | Offline unit tests: state-machine invalid-transition rejection, kill-at-every-transition-point durability; no live environment. |
| Completion evidence | State-machine coverage report, kill-at-transition recovery log. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: No ArcForges.Execution* project exists in DesktopPlatform yet. |
| Notes | Narrow early-risk proof: kill-at-any-transition durability underlies WP16.03-07, WP17.03 Task Centre and the vocabulary WP52 reuses. A defect here invalidates checkpoint/compensation/concurrency work built on top. |

### EXE.02 — Lifecycle states and reason facets

**Outcome.** Every reachable state carries a reason facet (waiting for approval, waiting for a resource, blocked on limit, paused, retrying) that reaches the UI; never a bare state alone.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / S |
| Obligations | [WP-16.01](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.01) — full |
| Provides | execution-reason-facets |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real state machine to attach reason facets to. *Why:* reason facets annotate the real transitions, not a mock enum |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Validation | Offline coverage test (every reachable state has a facet) plus a presentation test that the reason reaches the UI layer. |
| Completion evidence | Reason-facet coverage report. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-exe-03"></a>

### EXE.03 — Failure classification and retry

**Outcome.** Failures classify into transient/permanent/refused/cancelled/unknown-effect with effect certainty; an unknown-effect failure on a non-idempotent operation never auto-retries.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.02](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.02) — full |
| Provides | execution-failure-classification |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real state machine to classify failures against. *Why:* classification decisions drive real transitions |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Validation | Offline classification matrix test; negative test for non-idempotent unknown-effect auto-retry. |
| Completion evidence | Classification matrix, no-auto-retry proof. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Shares vocabulary only (not implementation) with the Cloud AgentTask failure model in requirements/05 ([WP-52](../../work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52)); no cross-repo dependency. |

<a id="task-exe-04"></a>

### EXE.04 — Child tasks and ownership

**Outcome.** A task may spawn children with their own lifecycle/budget/cancellation relationship; cancelling a parent cancels children, a failed child does not necessarily fail its parent, ownership is uniform across the tree.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.03](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.03) — full |
| Provides | execution-child-task-tree |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real state machine and persistence to attach child relationships to. *Why:* child ownership/cancellation must be durable, not in-memory only |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-assistant-store-schema](../shared-resources.md#res-assistant-store-schema) (append) |
| Validation | Offline tests: cancellation propagation, child-failure isolation, ownership assertion across the tree. |
| Completion evidence | Cancellation/isolation/ownership test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |

<a id="task-exe-05"></a>

### EXE.05 — Checkpoints and compensation

**Outcome.** Checkpoints capture resumable state at declared boundaries; compensation actions run in reverse order on abort; an undeclared irreversible effect fails validation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.04](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.04) — full<br>[WP-16](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16) Tool-result acceptance paragraph (between §5 and §6): two distinct toolRequestIds in one attempt both persist and each replay returns its own original receipt; a changed result under the same (toolRequestId,attemptId,commandId) refuses with command.reused_identifier; lost acknowledgement never allocates a fresh command or drops the second result. Bound to the wire registry, [TK-05](../../../architecture/contracts/01-public-api-operations.md#rule-tk-05) and task.tool_result -- the same key [WP-26.03](../../work-packages/26-remote-action-and-tool-bridge.md#rule-wp-26.03) uses. — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | execution-checkpoint-compensation |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real durable state machine to checkpoint. *Why:* resume-after-kill must exercise the real persistence |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [AST.13](assistant.md#task-ast-13), [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-assistant-store-schema](../shared-resources.md#res-assistant-store-schema) (append) |
| Validation | Offline tests: resume-from-checkpoint after kill, compensation-on-abort ordering, undeclared-irreversible validation failure. |
| Completion evidence | Resume and compensation-ordering test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Same (toolRequestId,attemptId,commandId) dedup key referenced by the WP16 'Tool-result acceptance' package-level obligation shared with DEV.04/DEV.05 -- see package_obligations. |

<a id="task-exe-06"></a>

### EXE.06 — Approval, steering and budget integration

**Outcome.** Approval gates pause a task durably until resolved/expired; steering adjusts a running task without granting authority; local resource permits (CPU/memory/disk/queue) are acquired before and released after a bounded job step, with no monetary accounting.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.05](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.05) — full |
| Provides | execution-approval-budget |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real durable state machine to pause/resume. *Why:* approval-pause-across-restart requires real durability<br>**artifact** [PLT.39](platform.md#task-plt-39) — published approval/steering/step-up mechanism. *Why:* [BR-06](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-06) requires approval be a discrete authorization from the real security pipeline, steering grants nothing |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**`<br>`DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution.Budget/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-assistant-store-schema](../shared-resources.md#res-assistant-store-schema) (append) |
| Validation | Offline tests: approval-pause across restart, steering-grants-nothing, resource-permit acquisition/release, bounded queue/memory exhaustion. |
| Completion evidence | Approval/steering/budget test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | [BR-07](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-07): local resource permits only, [D-020](../../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020) monetary accounting explicitly absent here (Cloud-owned). |

<a id="task-exe-07"></a>

### EXE.07 — Progress, outcome and trace

**Outcome.** Progress is a separate best-effort channel; outcome is durable fact; execution trace, capability trace and audit stay separate (provider-interaction records stay Cloud-only); a user-visible task identifier resolves to its execution trace. Losing all progress never affects the recorded outcome.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.06](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.06) — full |
| Provides | execution-progress-outcome-trace |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real durable state machine to record outcome against. *Why:* the conflation test requires a real outcome record independent of progress delivery |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Validation | Offline tests: progress-loss-never-affects-outcome, task-id-to-trace resolution, trace-system separation. |
| Completion evidence | Conflation-test result, trace-resolution result, trace-separation result; payload/manifest hashes with content-origin carrier per WP16 §7 addition. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Content-origin behavior/carrier schema (requirements/07, requirements/13) is a frozen design input already decided, not a blocking producer task. |

<a id="task-exe-08"></a>

### EXE.08 — Concurrency, loops and storms

**Outcome.** Per-product and per-device/resource concurrency limits; loop detection preventing plan re-entry into the same step; storm protection preventing automation cascade; each limit produces a typed, explained refusal rather than silent unbounded queuing.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-16.07](../../work-packages/16-unified-execution-engine.md#rule-wp-16.07) — full |
| Provides | execution-concurrency-guard |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXE.01](#task-exe-01) — the real state machine and job tree to bound. *Why:* loop/cascade detection operates on real step re-entry and real child trees (EXE.04) |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXE.09](#task-exe-09) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Execution/**` |
| Validation | Offline tests: loop-injection, cascade-injection, saturation with explained refusal. |
| Completion evidence | Loop/cascade/saturation test results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Storm/cascade protection here is the native counterpart engine-level guard; the durable Cloud trigger scheduler itself is [WP-52.06](../../work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52.06) (see AST.14 substitute). |

<a id="task-exe-09"></a>

### EXE.09 — Owned-artifact receipt and real integration

**Outcome.** ProductJob-only responsibility preserved (no local model loop, no Cloud budget/Task ownership in the shared engine); shared execution vocabulary/package references, dispatch/error profiles and cancellation updated; pending later owners ([WP-52](../../work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52)) and their closing gates recorded.

| Field | Value |
