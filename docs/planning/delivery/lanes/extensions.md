## Tasks

<a id="task-ext-00"></a>

### EXT.00 — Extension host process and supervision

**Outcome.** Per-installation extension processes start on demand and stop when idle inside the package-specific OS isolation profile; resource limits are enforced by termination, crashes trigger backoff restart then quarantine, in-flight invocations fail typed, and no ambient credential is inherited.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Kind / size | producer / L · early risk proof |

| Provides | extension-host |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [PLT.45](platform.md#task-plt-45) — the OS-level process isolation / ContentSandbox primitives (broker grants, syscall restriction). *Why:* [BR-01](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-01)/[PG-22](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-22) require actual packaged-RID isolation; the extension host reuses [WP-11](../../work-packages/11-security-foundation.md#rule-wp-11)'s isolation infrastructure rather than building a new sandbox -- a substitute would fail [PG-22](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-22)'s 'no same-user full-trust fallback' bar<br>**contract** [PLT.19](platform.md#task-plt-19) — the typed capability/resource contribution model. *Why:* the host must enforce the same capability model first-party code uses, per [WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41)'s own input table |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.01](#task-ext-01), [EXT.09](#task-ext-09), [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Runtime/Host/**` |
| Validation | Hostile-package tests against product DB/token paths, network, sibling-package and process APIs on the real target OS per platform (Windows primary; no macOS CI per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)); crash/hang/memory-exhaustion/unbounded-output tests; quarantine behaviour; credential-absence assertion. No device/emulator CI -- these run as local/affected-scope checks per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017). |
| Completion evidence | Hostile-process behaviour and credential-absence results ([PG-22](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-22)). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |
| Notes | Narrow early risk proof: if real OS-level sandboxing cannot reach [PG-22](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-22)'s bar on the target platforms, the whole out-of-process extension model needs redesign. |

<a id="task-ext-01"></a>

### EXT.01 — Handshake and protocol versioning

**Outcome.** Identity is verified against the installed manifest before any contribution is invoked; more than one protocol version is negotiated during a migration window; impersonation and reserved-namespace claims are refused with a clean explanation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.01](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.01) — full |
| Provides | extension-handshake |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.00](#task-ext-00) — a running extension process to handshake with. *Why:* handshake happens over the process EXT.00 supervises |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Runtime/Handshake/**` |
| Validation | Impersonation and reserved-namespace negative tests; version-negotiation matrix including refusal -- offline/local, no live device needed. |
| Completion evidence | Impersonation, namespace and negotiation results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |

<a id="task-ext-02"></a>

### EXT.02 — Dual capability boundary (typed layer + closed dynamic value model)

**Outcome.** The typed extension-point layer exists as ordinary versioned contracts and the dynamic layer as the closed, AOT-safe StructuredValue/ValueSchema model with bidirectional validation; a repository policy test proves StructuredValue never appears in a first-party domain or product contract, and the host still publishes AOT cleanly.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Contracts (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Contracts`); integration owner: Contracts integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / L · early risk proof |
| Obligations | [WP-41.02](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.02) — full |
| Provides | dual-capability-boundary |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.05](contracts.md#task-con-05) — the published foundation/value-model proto types this layer extends. *Why:* StructuredValue must build on the already-published foundation types (e.g. arcforges.foundation.v1), not a parallel definition |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.03.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-03-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.03](#task-ext-03), [EXT.04](#task-ext-04), [EXT.08](#task-ext-08), [EXT.90](#task-ext-90), [SCOPE.25](arcscope.md#task-scope-25) |
| Write scope | `Contracts:public/proto/arcforges/extensions/v1/**`<br>`DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Contracts/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-contracts-schema-sources](../shared-resources.md#res-contracts-schema-sources) (append) |
| Validation | Value-model coverage per type; bidirectional validation tests; containment policy test with a negative fixture; an AOT publish with the platform present (native AOT compile check, permitted under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)). |
| Completion evidence | Value-model, validation, containment and AOT results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed scaffold, unreviewed: Contracts already has public/proto/arcforges/extensions/v1/extensions.proto with ExtensionLease/ExtensionHostService.RenewLease and a generated ArcForges.Sdk.Client (ExtensionLeaseClient.cs) -- WP-03-level groundwork this task extends, not yet the StructuredValue/ValueSchema model itself. |
| Notes | [WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41) Sec.1 names the AOT-vs-dynamic-value tension as 'the platform's hardest design problem' -- narrow early risk proof. |

<a id="task-ext-03"></a>

### EXT.03 — Declarative UI and settings contribution

**Outcome.** Panel declarations from a closed, versioned element vocabulary render with first-party controls; settings schemas are declarative; secret fields yield references only; extension-contributed surfaces are visibly attributed.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.03](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.03) — full |
| Provides | extension-declarative-ui |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.02](#task-ext-02) — the closed StructuredValue/panel.v1 schema. *Why:* panel declarations are validated against the same closed value model EXT.02 defines |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Runtime/DeclarativeUi/**` |
| Validation | Vocabulary coverage tests; negative test for raw markup/script rejection; secret-field test; attribution test -- all offline UI-layer tests. |
| Completion evidence | Vocabulary, markup-rejection, secret and attribution results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |

<a id="task-ext-04"></a>

### EXT.04 — Package manifest/workflow/panel validators and lifecycle state machine

**Outcome.** manifest.v1/workflow.v1/panel.v1 validators exist from published Contracts, and package installation moves only through the immutable staged states (acquired/verified/staged/awaitingConsent/active/disabled/quarantined/removed) with no state that resets an effect fence.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Contracts (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Contracts`); integration owner: Contracts integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.04](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.04) — manifest.v1/workflow.v1/panel.v1 validators and the immutable staged install/update/drain/migration/revocation/rollback state machine |
| Provides | package-lifecycle-engine |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.02](#task-ext-02) — the closed value model workflow.v1 nodes are typed against. *Why:* workflow.v1 DAG nodes are StructuredValue-typed and must validate against EXT.02's schema validator<br>**artifact** [CON.16](contracts.md#task-con-16) — [WP-03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03) fixture signing/catalog keys (catalog/index/revocation/update/realm schemas + independent signed vectors). *Why:* archive signature verification in the lifecycle state machine needs a signed vector to check against; production keys are not required this early (see SUB-catalog-fixture-signing) |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.03.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-03-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.05](#task-ext-05), [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Permitted substitutes | [SUB-signed-format-fixture-keys](../substitutes.md#sub-signed-format-fixture-keys) |
| Write scope | `Contracts:public/proto/arcforges/extensions/v1/**`<br>`DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Packaging/Lifecycle/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-contracts-schema-sources](../shared-resources.md#res-contracts-schema-sources) (append) |
| Validation | Archive traversal/size/signature tests, DAG bounds (maxItems<=100, nesting<=2, 256 expanded steps), increased-permission re-consent, active-old-job, private-state rollback incompatibility, unknown-effect tests -- all offline against fixture-signed archives. |
| Completion evidence | Lifecycle matrix, re-consent, uninstall and revoke results (part). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |

<a id="task-ext-05"></a>

### EXT.05 — Six contribution-kind runtime wiring

**Outcome.** Each of the six contribution kinds registers and executes through the lifecycle engine and the dual capability boundary; a running task freezes the package version it started with ([BR-10](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-10)); uninstall never cascade-deletes professional resources the extension created ([BR-11](../../work-packages/00-specification-naming-and-rights-freeze.md#rule-br-11)).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / L |
| Obligations | [WP-41.04](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.04) — the six package contribution kinds (skill/template/workflow/mcp/connector/extension) runtime registration and execution wiring |
| Provides | extension-contribution-kinds |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.04](#task-ext-04) — the lifecycle state machine to register kinds into. *Why:* a contribution kind has nothing to attach to before install states exist |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Registry/Contributions/**` |
| Validation | Per-kind lifecycle tests; version-freeze-during-running-task test; uninstall-preserves-resources test -- offline. |
| Completion evidence | Lifecycle matrix, re-consent, uninstall and revoke results (remainder). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |

<a id="task-ext-06"></a>

### EXT.06 — Cloud PackageCatalog producer

**Outcome.** Cloud PackageCatalog accepts immutable submissions with DNS publisher verification, holds review-state/revocation authority and produces a signed static index; only OperatorService (not the console or the Extensions implementation) writes PackageCatalog tables.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / L |
| Obligations | [WP-41.05](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.05) — Cloud PackageCatalog producer: DNS publisher verification, immutable submissions, review-state/revocation authority, signed static index<br>[WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41) PackageCatalog ownership paragraph (Sec.5-6 boundary): OperatorService is sole authenticator/caller; neither Extensions Runtime nor console writes PackageCatalog tables — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | package-catalog-producer |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [CLOUD.16](cloud.md#task-cloud-16) — publisher identity/PAT and operator authentication. *Why:* owner/PAT/operator separation is a completion requirement; catalog submission must authenticate against the real identity surface<br>**artifact** [CLOUD.42](cloud.md#task-cloud-42) — durable blob storage for submitted package archives. *Why:* immutable submissions need durable, content-addressed storage<br>**artifact** [CON.16](contracts.md#task-con-16) — [WP-03](../../work-packages/03-contract-foundation-and-licence-split.md#rule-wp-03) fixture catalog/index/revocation/update/realm schemas and signed vectors. *Why:* the index producer can be built and tested against fixture signing keys before [WP-53](../../work-packages/53-desktop-distribution-and-update.md#rule-wp-53) production keys exist (see SUB-catalog-fixture-signing) |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-07-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.07](#task-ext-07), [EXT.08](#task-ext-08), [EXT.90](#task-ext-90), [OPS.11](operations.md#task-ops-11) |
| Write scope | `Cloud:src/Modules/PackageCatalog/PackageCatalog.Domain/**`<br>`Cloud:src/Modules/PackageCatalog/PackageCatalog.Application/**`<br>`Cloud:src/Modules/PackageCatalog/PackageCatalog.Infrastructure/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-cloud-host-composition](../shared-resources.md#res-cloud-host-composition) (append) |
| Validation | Owner/PAT/operator separation, duplicate-version conflict, invalid archive, review/revoke replay, signed-index rollback/expiry, offline installed-package behavior -- Cloud integration tests against ephemeral D1, no live DNS/public network in CI. |
| Completion evidence | Hostile catalog and unreachable-catalog results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |

<a id="task-ext-07"></a>

### EXT.07 — Desktop and CLI catalog consumers

**Outcome.** Desktop and CLI consume the signed static index and PackageCatalog methods to install/update packages, with correct offline behavior when the catalog is unreachable.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.05](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.05) — desktop/CLI catalog consumers |
| Provides | package-catalog-consumers |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.06](#task-ext-06) — the real signed static index format and PackageCatalog API. *Why:* a consumer cannot be finished against an unpublished producer shape, though it may develop against EXT.06's fixture-signed index first |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Extensions/ArcForges.Extensions.Registry/CatalogClient/**` |
| Validation | Catalog-unavailable-never-disables-installed-packages test; signed-index rollback/expiry consumption test -- offline. |
| Completion evidence | Hostile catalog and unreachable-catalog results (consumer half). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |
| Notes | [WP-45](../../work-packages/45-operations-support-and-trust-safety.md#rule-wp-45) (the commerce, policy and operations lanes OPS review console) is a downstream consumer of these same EXT.06/07 methods -- noted for integration owner cross-check, not a completion blocker here. |

<a id="task-ext-08"></a>

### EXT.08 — Public SDK and CLI

**Outcome.** The SDK, validators and tool-payload projections generate from authored public proto; the CLI uses eligible publisher PAT and catalog/resource methods; validate matches host install checks; no generated schema is inferred from C# reflection.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Contracts (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Contracts`); integration owner: Contracts integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.06](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.06) — full<br>[WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41) Sec.8 gate item 8: MCP vocabulary mapping + SDK version pin -- [VG-02](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-02) — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | extension-public-sdk |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.02](#task-ext-02) — the published extension protocol/value-model proto to generate from. *Why:* the SDK generator's input is EXT.02's authored proto<br>**artifact** [CLOUD.16](cloud.md#task-cloud-16) — publisher PAT issuance. *Why:* the CLI publish flow requires a real PAT-scoped identity |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.03.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-03-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [EXT.06](#task-ext-06) — the real Cloud PackageCatalog submit endpoint. *Why:* CLI publish must submit for review against the real endpoint, not a fixture, to close this substep's own gate ('CLI publish submits for review and never uploads directly into public catalog visibility') |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `Contracts:src/SDK/ArcForges.SDK.*/**`<br>`Contracts:src/SDK/ArcForges.Cli/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-contracts-schema-sources](../shared-resources.md#res-contracts-schema-sources) (append) |
| Validation | Independent SDK consumer test, manifest/tag compatibility, PAT scope tests, generated-vs-reflection negative test -- offline codegen tests. |
| Completion evidence | Generator, validate-parity and first-party build results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed scaffold, unreviewed: Contracts already has src/public/dotnet/ArcForges.Sdk.Client and ArcForges.Sdk.Contracts with generated ExtensionLeaseClient.cs and proto-generated types -- early groundwork, not the full SDK/CLI generator this task builds. |

<a id="task-ext-09"></a>

### EXT.09 — Local MCP stdio behind the owned connector child

**Outcome.** Local MCP servers run stdio behind an owned connector child process; only that child speaks ArcForges gRPC; origin/scope changes invalidate consent; no browser/Android local subprocess exists; child crash/lease recovery works.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | DesktopPlatform (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\DesktopPlatform`); integration owner: DesktopPlatform integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.07](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.07) — local MCP stdio placement behind the owned connector child process<br>[WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41) Sec.8 gate item 8: MCP vocabulary mapping + SDK version pin -- [VG-02](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-02) — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | mcp-local-placement |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [EXT.00](#task-ext-00) — the extension host's process supervision primitives. *Why:* the connector child reuses the same supervised-process model EXT.00 builds, per [BR-01](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-01)'s out-of-process default |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-02-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:src/Communication/Mcp/**` |
| Validation | Origin/scope-change consent invalidation test; no-unrestricted-AI-fetch test; child crash/lease recovery test -- offline/local process tests. |
| Completion evidence | MCP mapping record, connector secret and no-delegation structural results (local half). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform repo has no src/Extensions or src/Communication tree; only src/Build, src/BuildingBlocks, src/DesktopHelpers, src/Native exist. |

<a id="task-ext-10"></a>

### EXT.10 — Cloud MCP HTTP through the AI Worker adapter

**Outcome.** Cloud-placed MCP connections route HTTP through the AI Worker adapter only; standard MCP protocol is preserved; each connection has one placement/secret owner and exact failure/egress behavior; MCP content is treated as untrusted data.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | AI (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\AI`); integration owner: AI integration owner |
| Kind / size | producer / M |
| Obligations | [WP-41.07](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41.07) — Cloud MCP HTTP placement through the AI Worker adapter<br>[WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41) Sec.8 gate item 8: MCP vocabulary mapping + SDK version pin -- [VG-02](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-02) — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | mcp-cloud-placement |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.15](contracts.md#task-con-15) — the internal AI HTTP port surface to attach an MCP adapter route to. *Why:* the AI Worker's internal port registry (the Cloud lane public API generation) must exist before a new adapter route can be added without breaking the fixed registry |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.08.extensions](adoption.md#task-adopt-08-extensions) — the adoption slice for this repository and lane is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | [EXT.90](#task-ext-90) |
| Write scope | `AI:src/mcp/**` |

### EXT.90 — Verify owned artifact and real integration (extension platform)

**Outcome.** SDK/protocol, desktop host/runtime and Cloud registry ownership are verified split correctly; standard MCP transports and out-of-process extensions are preserved; no external-agent delegation or in-process third-party plugin exists anywhere; [VG-02](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-02) and [PG-09](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-09) close.
