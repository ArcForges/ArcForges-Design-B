## Tasks

<a id="task-gov-01"></a>

### GOV.01 — Specification, naming, licence-boundary and provenance freeze (WP00, accepted)

**Outcome.** WP00's naming/licence/provenance freeze is accepted across all nine implementation repositories: product-names.json, exported glossary/invariant policy data, per-project SPDX licence boundaries, a working provenance process and five registered Reference Coverage Matrices are in place, scanned clean, and enforced in CI.

| Notes | Executed across all nine implementation repositories plus Contracts' product-names.json; represented as one accepted task for the whole closed package rather than one task per substep, per the assignment's 'small number of GOV tasks' instruction. |

### GOV.02 — Repository reconciliation and target layout (WP01, accepted)

**Outcome.** WP01 reconciliation is accepted: nine-repository disposition inventory executed against ede43db, the Contracts public/internal Apache-2.0 split assigned, the shared-foundation boundary reviewed, native surface dispositions executed (OTIO admitted, MDF excluded), all eighteen test families mapped, bounded reconciliation applied with a green Notes build, and Cloud's 21 domain owners recorded.

### GOV.03 — Build governance, packaging policy and analyzers (WP02, accepted)

**Outcome.** WP02 build governance is accepted: pinned/locked toolchains in all nine owners, warnings-as-errors with an empty authored-code waiver list, a complete AOT/trim declaration sweep with zero unassigned diagnostics, verified runtime/directory boundaries, all nine version axes producible, and dependency-admission policy encoded as data.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | accepted — All seven substeps have 'Completed execution'/'Completed stage' blocks. WP02.04's own text notes 'WP02.05 was not started' as of 02.04's closure; WP02.05 was closed separately afterward per its own recorded-execution block in the same file - not a contradiction, just execution order. |
| Notes | [VG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-08) (framework upgrade re-verification) is explicitly recurring: WP02.05's evidence closes the first instance only; every future dependency/framework upgrade re-triggers [VG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-08) outside this task's own closure. |

### GOV.04 — Shared architecture/repository policy-test engine and DesktopPlatform enforcement

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed partial, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform/eng/design_graph.py and eng/design_policy.py (read directly, full text) implement adjacent but distinct corpus/graph checks over the DESIGN repo, not this task's own ArchitectureTests (see GOV.14 for what those two files actually assert). tests/ArchitectureTests/RepositoryPolicyTests.cs itself was not read (out of the minimal-reading scope given); WP05 section 4 states it currently has five bounded methods per the WP01.04 baseline. |

### GOV.05 — Contracts policy tests and contract/serialization policy engine

**Outcome.** Contracts enforces its own layering/licence/banned-API rules using GOV.04's shared engine, and implements the contract/serialization policy engine that makes [VG-04](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-04)'s policy-test half enforceable and that GOV.06-GOV.12 reuse for their own generated-client checks.

### GOV.06 — ArcNotes policy tests

**Outcome.** ArcNotes enforces its own layering/licence/naming/banned-API/contract-consumption rules independently, using GOV.04's shared engine and GOV.05's contract-policy helpers, with positive and failing-negative fixtures for each rule.

### GOV.13 — Invariant enforcement accounting report

**Outcome.** A build-produced report classifies all 429 catalogued invariants as enforced-and-passing / enforced-and-failing / not-yet-implemented, every classification derived from an actual test-run result, without re-deriving the design-stage mapping ([PG-06](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-06), already closed) and without itself closing [PG-11](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-11).

| Completion evidence | 429-row accounting table, every row classified from a real result. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Will read as mostly 'not yet implemented' immediately after WP05 since most of the 429 invariants are owned by packages far downstream (WP06...WP53, per invariant-coverage.md's ownerCell). [PG-11](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-11) stays open per-invariant in its OWNING package; GOV.13 never closes [PG-11](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-11) or [PG-06](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-06) itself - it only reports. |

### GOV.14 — Specification integrity checks over the Design repository

**Outcome.** Checks run against the current Design repository and produce zero findings: every internal link resolves; every cited requirement/architecture rule/decision/verification finding/gate identifier exists; no superseded name appears as current outside docs/deprecated-inputs/; every Phase 1 decision is cited by at least one Phase 2 document or its non-applicability is stated; the work-package dependency graph is acyclic with every referenced package existing; and the decision-coverage check passes.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed partial, unreviewed: DesktopPlatform/eng/design_graph.py:graph() (read in full) already implements: cross-checking implementation-sequence.md section 9's forward-dependency table against README.md's phase tables and its 'Downstream dependency index' reverse table (all three must agree, and reverse must be the exact transpose of forward); rejecting a producer reference to an inactive/nonexistent package; requiring every active WP file to declare exactly sections 1-9 with no duplicate numbering; requiring exactly one #rule-wp-NN.90 evidence row in each WP's own section 7; requiring implementation-sequence.md to carry a 'Serial execution:...' line that is a valid topological order of every active package (every producer ordered before its consumer) plus three exact hardcoded sentences ('All N active packages...', 'Total active dependency edges: E.', 'WP42.11 precedes 42.10.'). DesktopPlatform/eng/design_policy.py:verify() (read in full) additionally pins the ENTIRE Design corpus by commit+per-file sha256 (glossary/coverage/classifications sources plus one corpusSha256 over every doc), calls corpus.audit() for citation/anchor integrity (design_corpus.py itself not read), calls graph() above, and validates a citation-classification register (docs/assurance/citation-classifications.json) so every non-linked occurrence of a standard ID-shaped token anywhere in the corpus is either a normal citation or an explicit, dated, owned exception. This already covers the acyclic-graph check and much of link/citation integrity. NOT confirmed from this reading: the specific 23+8-row decision-coverage check against traceability-matrix.md, and whether superseded-name-outside-deprecated-inputs is checked here versus by WP00.00/WP05.02's separate forbidden-term scanner. |
| Notes | Implements the delivery-graph validation required by the design policy export specification under [P2-018](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018), replacing the retired package-graph and serial-order check; a precondition for moving the pinned Design commit (adoption stage section 5). |

### GOV.15 — WP05 stage integration verification

**Outcome.** Each of the nine repositories enforces its own boundary independently, and a cross-repository integration graph - reading each repository's published package/dependency metadata rather than cloning every reference or product repository - detects a forbidden transitive edge; both the architecture/repository-policy suite and the specification-integrity suite run in the pull-request pipeline and a violation fails the build.

### GOV.16 — Operation-catalogue authorization reachability matrix and identity boundary evidence

**Outcome.** A build-produced reachability matrix classifies every public/local/operator/CF/exception operation binding under catalogue 00 against all seven [AZ-04](../../../architecture/08-security-architecture.md#rule-az-04) authorization fields, failing on unclassified/ambiguous fields, impossible idempotency claims, public imports of local schema, and tool reachability of human-only approval/credential/commerce/policy methods, including hostile actor-chain fixtures; separately, the owner/deployment identity chain is asserted so automation loses authorization when its owner loses permission/service eligibility even with an otherwise-valid process credential, and no customer service-principal or Organization authority is introduced.

| Obligations | [WP-05](../../work-packages/05-architecture-and-repository-policy-tests.md#rule-wp-05) Section 7 operation-by-actor [AZ-04](../../../architecture/08-security-architecture.md#rule-az-04) authorization reachability matrix (public/local/operator/CF/exception bindings, hostile actor-chain fixtures, resource/context/connector egress denials) and section 8 'Identity boundary evidence' (owner/deployment identity chain; automation loses authorization when its owner loses eligibility) - both unlabeled, no [WP-05](../../work-packages/05-architecture-and-repository-policy-tests.md#rule-wp-05).MM anchor — package-level obligation contribution |
| Provides | authz-reachability-matrix-v1; identity-boundary-check |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.18](contracts.md#task-con-18) — generated catalogue 00 (operation-catalogue.md) [AZ-04](../../../architecture/08-security-architecture.md#rule-az-04) authorization-field descriptors. *Why:* the reachability matrix is generated FROM the catalogue's [AZ-04](../../../architecture/08-security-architecture.md#rule-az-04) fields; nothing to enumerate before WP03 generates them |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.03](adoption.md#task-adopt-03) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [CLOUD.11](cloud.md#task-cloud-11) — identity/workspace/device/session bindings. *Why:* operator/CF binding classification needs Cloud's actual session/identity model<br>**integration** [PLT.38](platform.md#task-plt-38) — the owner/deployment identity chain mechanism (the platform lane security foundation). *Why:* the identity-boundary check asserts against the real identity-chain implementation, not a description of it |
| Unblocks | none |
| Write scope | `Contracts:tests/AuthorizationPolicyTests/**` |
| Validation | Static/offline policy tests over each repository's DECLARED authorization metadata (generated attributes/descriptors), not live-system penetration testing, per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017). |
| Completion evidence | Reachability matrix with all seven [AZ-04](../../../architecture/08-security-architecture.md#rule-az-04) fields classified per binding, plus identity-boundary assertion results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Covers two WP05 package-level obligations that carry no [WP-05](../../work-packages/05-architecture-and-repository-policy-tests.md#rule-wp-05).MM anchor (the section 7 paragraph before the evidence table, and the section 8 'Identity boundary evidence' paragraph); see package_obligations. Genuinely cross-repository in subject matter (Contracts defines the catalogue; Cloud/DesktopPlatform implement the actual bindings) but modeled as a Contracts-owned static check over declared metadata, consistent with [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017). |
