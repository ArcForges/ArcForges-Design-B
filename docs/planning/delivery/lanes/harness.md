## Tasks

<a id="task-har-00"></a>

### HAR.00 — Turn loop, tool batching and bounds (RunWorkflow core)

**Outcome.** The sole RunWorkflow implements deterministic Workflow identity with C# claim/epoch/generation and actual deployed Worker version; iteration/context references and model/tool dispatch intent persist before effects; immutable outcome receipts persist before continuation; model/tool/parallel/progress/time/step budgets and declared conflict sets are enforced, with a 60-second execution lease renewed every 20 seconds during long awaits.

| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [AIR.00](ai-routing.md#task-air-00) — a dispatchable model/tool call target. *Why:* the loop has nothing to dispatch without a provider adapter; see SUB-provider-response-fixture for the early substitute |

| Validation | Real Workflow with forced duplicate start, replay, 120-second model await, lease loss/stale outcome, no-progress and every bound test; no automatic effect retry after intent. CF Workflow deployment tests apply to the loop per [BR-02](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-02); C# integration ports retain the AOT gate. Real CF only at the credentialed candidate gate, not ordinary CI ([P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)). |
| Completion evidence | Loop-bound, crash-resume, no-progress and conflict-batching results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: AI repo has no src/workflows tree; tests/workflow.test.ts and docs/evidence/workflow-*.json exist as early probe/evidence scaffolding only (WP-03-level), not the RunWorkflow implementation. |
| Notes | Foundational early risk proof: if the CF Workflow model cannot actually sustain the durable claim/epoch/generation + budget semantics at the required step-guard ceiling (24000 steps, 25000 hard ceiling per contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md), the entire single-Harness architecture is affected. |

### HAR.01 — Context assembly and compaction

**Outcome.** Context assembles through authorized C# ports in a fixed order, pages under one snapshot hash, and retains immutable source pins/content origins; invocable capabilities are filtered before model declaration with budget truncation disclosed; compaction refs are stored derived; source/revision and active grant are revalidated before mutation.

<a id="task-har-02"></a>

### HAR.02 — Approval, cancellation and crash recovery

**Outcome.** Approval waiting is bounded (selected wait/reconcile steps, seven-day bound) with reauthorization on resume; explicit cancel/pause/steer controls and C# reconciliation exist; wait/cancel/recovery always yields one canonical outcome or an explicit unknownEffect via the intent-to-owner/provider-evidence-to-deadline-to-user-decision ladder; a UI session closing never cancels a durable Task.

### HAR.03 — Generated streaming and durable output

**Outcome.** execution.readOutput/watchOutput, transient-turn admission/ack/purge and DO projections work per annex 10/model 05; Cloud histories commit canonically while local histories recover verified transient output without a Cloud Chat body; a stream projection never becomes message authority or determines Task state.

### HAR.04 — Provider failure and effect-certainty classification

**Outcome.** Failure classification keys on whether dispatch occurred, never on whether bytes returned; the unknown path releases customer holds at the reconciliation deadline while retaining supplier liability; no failure path silently resolves unknown to didNotHappen, and no dispatched request is retried automatically.

### HAR.05 — Own-application execution proof and fixture turn-endpoint removal

**Outcome.** Two end-to-end oracles pass: the ArcNotes embedded assistant processes its own selected document plus local/cloud history, and Android/Web explicitly target an authorized ArcNotes installation for an approved Notes command -- covering typed transcript/compaction, promotion/export, binary streams and offline recovery. The [WP-17.01](../../work-packages/17-arcchat-independent-core.md#rule-wp-17.01) fixture turn endpoint is structurally proven absent from the codebase.

### HAR.06 — Durable Cloud automation, scheduling and automation-fixture removal

**Outcome.** Automation definition/version, trigger schedule/event cursor, occurrence dedup and grant/budget snapshot live in C# Task-owned tables; bounded leased jobs dispatch the same RunWorkflow identity through the existing outbox; disabled/revoked automation stops future occurrences; the labelled [WP-17](../../work-packages/17-arcchat-independent-core.md#rule-wp-17) automation fixture is removed.

| Completion evidence | Real automation scheduling, missed-run policy, occurrence deduplication, cancellation and fixture-removal results (core mechanics). |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |
| Notes | The Slate transcription closure scenario named in [WP-52.06](../../work-packages/52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52.06)'s final-review paragraph is deliberately excluded from this task and modeled as IM.slate-transcription-adoption, since it needs [WP-39](../../work-packages/39-arcslate-integration-and-portability.md#rule-wp-39) real audio and this task's core scheduler mechanics do not. |

### HAR.90 — Verify owned artifact and real integration (Harness)

**Outcome.** The specified Worker/Workflow/DO roles are implemented and verified together; context, model/tool loop, approval, retries, cancel, streams and schedule execution run against real C# transactions/ports and selected Workers AI; the named [WP-17](../../work-packages/17-arcchat-independent-core.md#rule-wp-17) fixtures are confirmed removed; this package owns the first complete AI same-application workflow.
