## Tasks

<a id="task-nat-01"></a>

### NAT.01 — Probe A: device tool execution under Native AOT

**Outcome.** Inside a published Native AOT desktop binary, a stub ToolRequest is pulled, re-authorised locally, resolved through the generated allowlist to a CapabilityKey, decoded into a typed product request, invoked and returns an idempotent result -- with an AOT publish log showing zero diagnostics and a negative test proving no reflection-based registration/decode path compiles or exists.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: benchmarks/ directory does not exist yet in DesktopPlatform; this substep has zero scaffolding. |
| Notes | One of WP13's four canonical early risk proofs (package goal: 'retire the four early technical risks'). Parallel with NAT.02/03/04 (disjoint write scopes). |

### NAT.02 — Probe B: block editor, store, undo and recovery

**Outcome.** A minimal block editor over the local store demonstrates create/edit/reorder, undo/redo across a composite operation, and recovery from a hard process kill mid-edit that returns to the last committed boundary with uncommitted work explicitly reported as loss -- proving undo, revision, checkpoint and journal are four distinct mechanisms.

| Provides | probe-b-editor-recovery-proof |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [PLT.01](platform.md#task-plt-01) — the real local persistence single-writer journal/checkpoint mechanism. *Why:* the probe's recovery claim is meaningless against anything but the real journal; a fake store would hide exactly the recovery defects this probe exists to surface |

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: no benchmarks/probes/editor-store scaffolding found. |
| Notes | Parallel with NAT.01/03/04. |

<a id="task-nat-03"></a>

### NAT.03 — Probe C: high-throughput acquisition over a real transport

**Outcome.** Sustained acquisition from a real transport (at least one real TCP/UDP/serial configuration, not an in-memory generator, per [BR-06](../../../architecture/14-build-packaging-and-release.md#rule-br-06)) runs above the intended product target through a ring buffer with responsive plot downsampling; overrun is counted and timestamped, pausing the view never stops recording, and disconnect leaves an explicit gap.

| Notes | No hard start-dependency on any other WP -- can begin immediately using a real TCP/UDP loopback or serial-over-USB pair; exotic hardware is not required for the first real-transport configuration. Parallel with NAT.01/02/04. |

<a id="task-nat-04"></a>

### NAT.04 — Probe D: native decode and audio/video synchronisation

**Outcome.** Native decode through a thin C ABI shim displays one frame in the desktop shell with audio/video synchronised against a shared timeline clock; safe handles, managed-side input validation, a clean sanitiser run and a sacrificial-process crash test all pass; hardware acceleration is discovered at runtime with a proven software fallback.

| Provides | probe-d-decode-sync-proof |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [PRF.01](runtime-proofs.md#task-prf-01) — a shape for an AOT-published desktop shell capable of hosting a display surface. *Why:* the probe 'displays one frame in the desktop shell'; any of PRF.01-03 would equally satisfy this, PRF.01 is representative |

| Validation | Frame-display run; audio/video sync measurement; sanitiser run (ASan/UBSan); sacrificial-process crash test; forced-software-path run |
| Completion evidence | Frame display, synchronisation measurement, sanitiser and sacrificial-process results |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: no benchmarks/probes/media scaffolding found; DesktopPlatform's own native toolchain (CMake profiles, sanitiser support) is the real prerequisite and already exists per native-abi.yml. |
| Notes | GPU-accelerated path testing is necessarily per-local-machine (whatever GPU is available); the required CPU software-fallback path is universally testable. Parallel with NAT.01/02/03. |

<a id="task-nat-05"></a>

### NAT.05 — Probe evidence, licence positions, conclusions and hardware-lab inventory seed

**Outcome.** Each of the four probes has a written conclusion (proved / not proved / downstream constraint / open items); every native dependency the probes introduced has a recorded licence position; the tests/HardwareLab device inventory is created (device/firmware/driver versions) -- seeding [PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08) (completed later by NAT.28/[WP-13.16](../../work-packages/13-high-risk-technical-probes.md#rule-wp-13.16)).

| Write scope | `DesktopPlatform:eng/verification/probe-evidence/**`<br>`DesktopPlatform:tests/HardwareLab/**` |
| Validation | Completeness check: every probe has a recorded environment, procedure, result and conclusion |
| Completion evidence | Four written probe conclusions; licence positions for probe-introduced dependencies; hardware inventory shell |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: depends entirely on NAT.01-04 existing first. |
| Notes | Small synthesis task; not itself a risk probe. |

<a id="task-nat-06"></a>

### NAT.06 — Common native ABI: preambles, pack8 records, ownership, cancellation, bounded buffers

**Outcome.** annex-06 common preambles, fixed numeric keys, pack8 records, ownership/cancellation/bounded-buffer helpers compile as C17/C++20 headers and C# layouts for all seven families; every field offset and all 17 normative sizes are asserted; wrong-size/version/null/closed-handle cases and zero-leaked-output-on-failure are proven. ArcForges.Native.Abstractions managed package (status/handle types only) is published. The five existing probe-library identities (incl. arc_metal_*) are retained unchanged.

### NAT.07 — Media family: reader, probe, frame and seek (arc_media_reader_*)

**Outcome.** arc_media_reader_open/stream/seek/next/close and arc_media_buffer_* implemented over the selected FFmpeg demux/decode path and the WP11 restricted helper; stream metadata, delayed frames, EOF and seek epochs preserved; every export has a behavioral oracle and bounded isolated execution.

| Notes | Shares the arcmedia-ffmpeg-abi library/target with NAT.08 (writer/convert/resample) and NAT.09 (audio) -- see 'shared' entries. All three can be developed in parallel branches but should merge sequentially. |

<a id="task-nat-08"></a>

### NAT.08 — Media family: convert, resample and media writer

**Outcome.** arc_media_video_convert, arc_media_resampler_* and arc_media_writer_* implemented with the fixed portable profiles (FFV1/PCM/WAV, MP4 MPEG4-AAC); resampler delay/PTS preserved; writer commits only after complete output/sidecars/hash.

<a id="task-nat-09"></a>

### NAT.09 — Media family: audio devices (miniaudio)

**Outcome.** arc_media_audio_* implemented over miniaudio device/context/ring primitives with explicit negotiation, bounded rings, counters, disconnect/reopen; missing output device permits video-only playback with a stated reason without blocking offline export.

### NAT.11 — Image family: still-image codecs (PNG/TIFF/EXR)

### NAT.12 — Otio family: OTIO0.18.1 interchange

**Outcome.** arc_otio_read/write implemented under the official OTIO0.18.1 library with the selected schema allowlist and fidelity report; exact tick conversion preserved; unsupported schema/malicious path/parser-death cases reported as loss before commit, never silently.

### NAT.13 — Instruments family: serial and USB devices (NEW library)

**Outcome.** A new arcinstruments-abi native library and ArcForges.Native.Instruments managed package implement arc_instruments_* over generic OS serial and explicit libusb interface/endpoint open/read/write/cancel/close; identity revalidated at open; no auto-detach of unrelated drivers, no vendor SDK.

| Notes | Degradation-path code (enumeration, driver-absence reporting) does not require the [PG-08](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-08) lab to exist; the physical hot-unplug/permission-denial matrix against a named USB device does.. |

### NAT.14 — Pdf family: PDFium and production parser containment in the WP11 helper (NEW library)

**Outcome.** A new arcpdf-abi native library and ArcForges.Native.Pdf managed package implement arc_pdf_* over actual PDFium; PDFium and all approved parser wrappers are composed into the existing [WP-11.09](../../work-packages/11-security-foundation.md#rule-wp-11.09) ContentSandbox host using generated local gRPC controls (no second helper, no duplicate DTO owner); the next immutable ContentSandbox.Runtime.<rid> version is published; test-parser production registration is removed (hostile regression fixture retained). Contributes real evidence to [PG-12](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-12) and [PG-22](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-22).

### NAT.15 — Graphics family: portable CPU surface and optional OS backends (NEW library)

**Outcome.** A new arcgraphics-abi native library and ArcForges.Native.Graphics managed package implement ArcGraphicsNative CPU surface/upload/present/fence/device-loss behavior on all admitted RIDs; the existing arcgraphics-metal-abi probe ABI is preserved unchanged as a private optional backend, not claimed as functional acceleration by itself.

| Entry condition | [ADOPT.02](adoption.md#task-adopt-02) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |
| Unblocks | none |
| Write scope |  |
| Validation | Local real-integration run of the affected scenario in an existing environment, recorded once; offline and static checks in CI; no hosted runtime, device, browser, live-service or inference CI ([P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)). |
| Completion evidence | Decode/seek/drain, encode->independent decode, image tiles, colour, OTIO, PDF, instruments, graphics CPU/fallback, cancel/lifetime/hostile-helper vectors and missing-DLL/wrong-RID negative consumers, all against actual WP07 to WP12 mechanisms (persistence, local RPC, shell, ContentSandbox, telemetry) -- probe-only exports never pass; this is the gate WP14/WP33/WP36 consumers wait behind |
