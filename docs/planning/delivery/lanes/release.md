## Tasks

<a id="task-rel-01"></a>

### REL.01 — ArcNotes desktop release readiness

**Outcome.** ArcNotes' desktop release candidate passes the complete update matrix on all three platforms against a candidate/staging feed, and carries a complete licence/SBOM/provenance/NOTICE record for REL.07 to roll up.

| Field | Value |

| Entry condition | [ADOPT.04](adoption.md#task-adopt-04) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [REL.10](#task-rel-10) — production feed/signing cutover pointing at this proven candidate. *Why:* the update matrix can be rehearsed against a candidate/staging feed, but the desktop release is not actually complete until the production feed and signing switch points at the proven artifact |
| Unblocks | [REL.07](#task-rel-07), [REL.10](#task-rel-10), [REL.11](#task-rel-11) |

| Validation | Local opt-in runtime observation per platform under [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017)/ci-and-local-validation-policy.md; no macOS CI - an independently produced macOS installer has its own local build/signing evidence; Windows/Linux installers promote their original CI-produced candidates, never rebuilt. |
| Completion evidence | Full update-matrix results table per platform; licence/SBOM/provenance/NOTICE closure report for the ArcNotes artifact. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Analogous tasks exist for ArcScope (REL.02) and ArcSlate (REL.03); all three can run in parallel once their own product WP and WP53 are ready. |

### REL.04 — Android release readiness

**Outcome.** The Android artifact is submitted and live with every mobile gate closed and the store listing consistent with the consumption-only posture; post-release install and update are verified from the store channel.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Mobile (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Mobile`); integration owner: Mobile integration owner |
| Kind / size | release / M |

| Notes | [F-023](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023) final closure and [VG-13](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-13) (store category fit) are WP32's own gates, consumed here rather than produced. |

<a id="task-rel-05"></a>

### REL.05 — Web outputs release readiness

**Outcome.** Site/Account/Chat build once through the pinned Node/npm pipeline after current released proto-descriptor/C#/TS compatibility checks, promote the same artifacts with manifest and safe runtime-config schema, deploy atomically with per-origin edge routing/opaque cookie/CSRF policy/CSP, preserve old hashed chunks for the compatibility window, and roll back headers/assets/config coherently, while keeping production Node servers and esproj/npm installs out of Cloud runtime; the full browser-support.v1 matrix passes for supported/degraded/blocked behavior.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Web (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Web`); integration owner: Web integration owner |
| Kind / size | release / L |

| Provides | web-release-live; pg-23-web-contribution |
| Start prerequisites | **release** [WEB.26](web.md#task-web-26) — ArcChat Web Companion complete (the Web and Android lanes WEB area). *Why:* WP50.06 releases Site/Account/Chat together<br>**release** [WEB.09](web.md#task-web-09) — Static Public Site complete (the Web and Android lanes WEB area). *Why:* same joint-release reasoning<br>**release** [WEB.18](web.md#task-web-18) — Account Portal complete (the Web and Android lanes WEB area). *Why:* same joint-release reasoning |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.09](adoption.md#task-adopt-09) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | none |

| Write scope | `Web:eng/release/**`<br>`Design:docs/assurance/wp50-06-web-*.md` |
| Validation | Production asset/real C# integration in the supported browser matrix; public no-script content, auth/CSRF/expiry/replica revocation, paid-checkout return, Task recovery; visual/accessibility/performance budgets; atomic switch/rollback, cached-client/chunk failure, route-fallback/API-error separation; npm SBOM/provenance and Windows/CLI evidence; no fixture-only substitution; real-browser evidence per browser-support.v1, not Playwright-WebKit-only for Safari/OS-authenticator claims. |
| Completion evidence | [PG-23](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-23) combined production release/rollback evidence; browser-matrix acceptance results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Owns the unlabeled 'Browser matrix acceptance' package obligation appended after [WP-50.90](../../work-packages/50-full-platform-production-release.md#rule-wp-50.90); see package_obligations. Joins WP23/45/47/48/49 production hashes with real browser evidence per that paragraph. |

### REL.06 — Cloud/AI production readiness (deployment, migration, backup, self-host)

**Outcome.** Cloud is deployed from a promoted, never-rebuilt artifact with rehearsed migration/rollback, proven backup/restore, a live status page with emergency alternate URL, and the approved/measured capacity envelope plus independently operated self-host deployment evidence required for [L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16)/[PG-25](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-25)/[PG-26](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-26), on a genuine Native AOT publish.

| Provides | cloud-production-deployed; vg-06-wp50-contribution; pg-19-wp50-contribution |
| Start prerequisites | **release** [CLOUD.51](cloud.md#task-cloud-51) — D1/R2 disaster-recovery mechanism complete. *Why:* backup/restore rehearsal needs the actual recovery mechanism, not a description of it<br>**release** [AIR.90](ai-routing.md#task-air-90) — Workers AI routing/metering complete (the AI lanes AIR area). *Why:* AI is included in this production surface<br>**artifact** [GOV.03](governance.md#task-gov-03) — Cloud's Native AOT build posture (GOV.03). *Why:* [L-01](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-01)..[L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16) evidence requires the promoted candidate to already be a genuine Native AOT publish, not a JIT stand-in<br>**release** [CLOUD.10](cloud.md#task-cloud-10) — Cloud host closure and launch-capacity acceptance. *Why:* production readiness includes the real launch-capacity evidence<br>**release** [CLOUD.20](cloud.md#task-cloud-20) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [CLOUD.28](cloud.md#task-cloud-28) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [CLOUD.36](cloud.md#task-cloud-36) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [CLOUD.47](cloud.md#task-cloud-47) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [CLOUD.55](cloud.md#task-cloud-55) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [COM.15](commerce.md#task-com-15) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [POL.10](policy.md#task-pol-10) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [OPS.12](operations.md#task-ops-12) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [SRCH.90](search.md#task-srch-90) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [EXT.90](extensions.md#task-ext-90) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [HAR.90](harness.md#task-har-90) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence<br>**release** [SIM.08](simulator.md#task-sim-08) — obligation package accepted. *Why:* Cloud and AI production readiness requires every Cloud and AI obligation package accepted with its evidence |

| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [REL.09](#task-rel-09) — the combined disaster drill actually exercised against this deployed production topology. *Why:* [L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16) and the cloud go-live threshold require a completed game day; deployment alone does not prove 'failure behaves correctly' |
| Unblocks | [REL.07](#task-rel-07), [REL.09](#task-rel-09), [REL.11](#task-rel-11) |
| Write scope | `Cloud:eng/release/**`<br>`Cloud:deploy/production/**`<br>`Design:docs/assurance/wp50-04-cloud-*.md` |
| Validation | Production-shaped migration/rollback rehearsal against real Cloudflare topology; archived launch-capacity.v1 hash, actual standard-2 allocation/four global slots/ten-minute sleep, warm/cold/burst/fallback-read workload, D1/Vectorize/R2 dimensions and provider prices; explicit Product/Operations approval required for [L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16)/[PG-26](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-26) - not markable complete from document checks alone. |
| Completion evidence | Per-gate go-live evidence [L-01](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-01)..[L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16) (except the drill); backup/restore proof; self-host deployment evidence. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | The game-day exercise itself is split out to REL.09 per the assignment's explicit 'combined disaster drill' bucket. |

### REL.08 — Commercial activation

**Outcome.** Account portal and checkout run in production; official pricing is published only after entitlement, refunds, webhook idempotency and a RECEIVED payout are all proven - until then the public statement is 'technical integration complete'; the regional route remains disabled unless its own gates are met.

### REL.09 — Combined disaster drill and operational readiness confirmation

**Outcome.** A game-day exercise across the full severity ladder runs against the real deployed production topology with recorded evidence for every go-live gate; every alert maps to a rehearsed runbook, on-call is in place, and support/enforcement/appeal paths are operable.

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started |
| Notes | Named explicitly in the assignment as its own bucket ('combined disaster drill'); folds WP50.07 in alongside WP50.04's game-day portion since both are evidence of the same severity-ladder incident-response exercise. |

### REL.10 — Production update feed and signing switch

**Outcome.** The production update feed is populated with hashes/compatibility ranges/minimum versions for all three desktop products across Windows/macOS/Linux, store and package-manager listings point at the corresponding signed installer, and a blocked bad version is refused by both the feed and compatibility policy.

### REL.11 — Family release readiness audit and honest statement

**Outcome.** Every gate in release-gates.md is evaluated for every surface with a named, resolvable evidence artifact; every still-open gate's blocking consequence is stated; no cross-system failure row in architecture/20-cross-system-lifecycles.md lacks a run test; every public claim is backed by gate evidence, iOS is explicitly stated as outside current scope, and nothing incomplete is presented as complete.
