### PRF.04 — Local RPC under AOT: bidirectional named-pipe/UDS probe processes

**Outcome.** Two published AOT desktop probe processes complete LocalBootstrap over Kestrel HTTP/2 named-pipe (Windows) / UDS (Linux/macOS), authenticate same-user peers, register both endpoint directions, invoke generated services, cancel, disconnect and reattach; malformed-input/unauthorized-peer/bounded-resource negative tests pass.

### PRF.05 — Generated gRPC-Web under AOT against deployed Worker/Container ingress

**Outcome.** A published AOT desktop probe calls the real generated binary gRPC-Web client against actual deployed Worker/Container ingress, proving headers, trailers, cancellation, scoped errors and exact primitives; [F-026](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-026) closes on this artifact.

### PRF.06 — Realtime (EventService.Watch/Poll) under AOT

**Outcome.** A published AOT desktop probe proves EventService.Watch and output server streams plus Poll/readOutput recovery from annex 10 against actual Worker/Container/DO, including drop/expire/revoke and recovery through authoritative reads; no SignalR dependency, no claimed hint durability beyond what is proven.

### PRF.07 — Cloudflare Native AOT host + D1 + DO/Queue/R2 foundation proof

**Outcome.** ArcForges.Cloud.Host publishes/deploys as a Linux x64 Native AOT container with the real private Worker D1 binding, DO/Queue/R2 foundation, rollback on guard failure, exact 64-bit/decimal handling, session/CSRF/revoke and bounded checkpoint/restart; zero trim/AOT diagnostics; [VG-06](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-06) is supported (not yet closed platform-wide, since [VG-06](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-06) is also maintained by [WP-21.00](../../work-packages/21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21.00)/[WP-50.04](../../work-packages/50-full-platform-production-release.md#rule-wp-50.04)).

### PRF.08 — React production build and generated TS SDK proof

**Outcome.** Minimal Account/Chat production React profiles build from Web root locks using the exact released generated gRPC-Web SDK, call the real AOT Cloud probe through same-origin routing/cookie/CSRF, exercise exact values/typed failures/cancellation and CF authenticated presentation; asset/interaction budgets measured; esproj and portable npm entry points proven.

### PRF.09 — Third-party control AOT admission gate and first candidate

**Outcome.** The process for admitting a third-party UI control into an AOT deliverable is documented and exercised once against a real candidate control published AOT with zero diagnostics; schedules [VG-03](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-03) for WP10.

### PRF.10 — Android Kotlin/Jetpack Compose gRPC-Web and CF proof

**Outcome.** A Kotlin Android release build consumes the actual Maven Connect Kotlin gRPC-Web client, exercises unary/server-stream/trailers/cancel/Keystore against real Worker/Container/D1/DO/R2 foundation; the compatible actual toolchain is pinned after proof. Closes [VG-07](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-07) and the first-artifact leg of [F-023](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-023) (already CLOSED for the inspected android-0.1.0-ci.14.1 replacement per the gates register, but reopens on dependency/resource change).

| Notes | Different runtime family (Kotlin/JVM) from the rest of WP06 -- genuine independent risk axis. |
