## Tasks

<a id="task-srch-00"></a>

### SRCH.00 — Source admission and registration for search

**Outcome.** Own-product content, explicitly selected uploads and authorized web sources are admitted into the search source registry with origin/egress and consent recorded; other-product, other-realm and private resources are rejected before any index write.

| Field | Value |

| Provides | search-source-registry |
| Start prerequisites | **contract** [CON.10](contracts.md#task-con-10) — published SourceRecord/ContentOrigin typed record (origin, consent, egress) in Contracts public schema. *Why:* admission must persist a typed, versioned origin/consent record before any content is queued for indexing; the exact CON substep that publishes this record was not determined from this area's WP files<br>**artifact** [CLOUD.37](cloud.md#task-cloud-37) — durable resource identity/revision for synced product content. *Why:* admitted sources need a stable resource id and revision to key the derived index against; [WP-25](../../work-packages/25-sync-engine-and-blob-lifecycle.md#rule-wp-25) owns the sync engine and blob lifecycle that assigns these<br>**artifact** [AIR.06](ai-routing.md#task-air-06) — operator-funded web-search dispatch capability (Brave), or its contract-bound fixture. *Why:* 'authorized web sources' admission is dispatched through the AI Worker web-search port, funded/owned by [WP-43.05](../../work-packages/43-managed-ai-routing-and-metering.md#rule-wp-43.05); SRCH.00 can build against a fixture web-search response and defer the real call to SRCH.06 |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07](adoption.md#task-adopt-07) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Shared resources | [RES-cloud-host-composition](../shared-resources.md#res-cloud-host-composition) (append) |
| Validation | Offline unit + Cloud integration tests against the real D1 schema in an ephemeral test host; no live web fetch in CI ([P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) forbids live-service CI) -- the web-source path is exercised through the fixture web-search response only. |
| Completion evidence | Rejection-before-snippet test matrix (other-product/realm/private), consent/origin record contents, source registration receipt. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |
| Notes | [WP-40](../../work-packages/40-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-wp-40) has no explicit Sec.4 project/file table unlike [WP-41](../../work-packages/41-extension-platform-and-integrations.md#rule-wp-41)/43/52; the Cloud module path above is this agent's convention-based inference, not sourced WP text -- flagged in report.md. |

### SRCH.01 — Scoped derived index production (D1 FTS + Vectorize)

**Outcome.** D1 FTS scoped queries and per-workspace Vectorize namespaces are produced with mandatory realm/product/model-generation filters, source revision/policy checks, rebuild pointers, tombstone reconciliation and dimensional-change isolation (separate index, atomic reader switch, rollback window).

| Validation | Offline unit tests for index math with fixture vectors; D1/Vectorize behavior exercised against local/emulated CF bindings per [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) (no live CF in ordinary CI); [L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16) index/namespace footprint measured locally. |
| Completion evidence | Cross-product/tenant isolation before topK, stale deletion, unavailable canonical owner, lexical fallback, [L-16](../../../assurance/release-gates.md#rule-l-16) footprint measurement. |

### SRCH.02 — Hybrid retrieval, RRF fusion and budgets

**Outcome.** Lexical (D1 FTS) and semantic (Vectorize) candidates are fused with RRF(x)=sum(1/(60+rank_i(x))), exact-match priority preserved, the Notes scalar comparator never reordered by vector score, and RetrievalBudget defaults (candidates 200/500, evidence 20/100, contextTokens 8192/24000, perSource 5/20, graphDepth 1/3) enforced.

<a id="task-srch-03"></a>

### SRCH.03 — Current permission recheck at query time

**Outcome.** Source owner permission and revision are rechecked after candidate retrieval and before any count/snippet/citation is returned; revocation during a query and a stale index can never expose content.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / S |
| Obligations | [WP-40.03](../../work-packages/40-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-wp-40.03) — full |
| Provides | retrieval-permission-recheck |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SRCH.02](#task-srch-02) — ranked candidate list to filter. *Why:* nothing to recheck before candidates exist<br>**artifact** [CLOUD.11](cloud.md#task-cloud-11) — live owner/grant permission check API. *Why:* the recheck must call the actual current-permission source of truth, not a cached copy; the Cloud lane [WP-22](../../work-packages/22-identity-workspace-and-device.md#rule-wp-22) is presumed to own identity/grant checks (exact substep not read from this area) |

<a id="task-srch-04"></a>

### SRCH.04 — Evidence and citations

**Outcome.** Retrieval results retain source kind, immutable reference, anchor, uncertainty/completeness and measurement/media precision; stale or missing sources are labelled and no citation is ever fabricated.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / M |

| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |

<a id="task-srch-05"></a>

### SRCH.05 — Privacy partitioning and cache isolation

**Outcome.** Cache, history and context are partitioned by product/profile per [RI-01](../../../architecture/data-model/03-derived-stores.md#rule-ri-01)..03 (workspace+principal key, no cross-workspace reuse); temporary/local Cloud-processing content never enters Cloud search.

| Owning repository | Cloud (`C:\MyFile\Projects\ArcForges\Cloud`); integration owner: Cloud integration owner |
| Kind / size | service / M |

| Provides | retrieval-privacy-partitioning |
| Start prerequisites | **artifact** [SRCH.01](#task-srch-01) — index/cache tables to partition. *Why:* partitioning is enforced at the same storage SRCH.01 creates |
| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07](adoption.md#task-adopt-07) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |

| Completion evidence | Marker test, cross-app/account leakage and purge results. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |

### SRCH.06 — Real Cloud query path (fixture-to-real swap)

**Outcome.** The retrieval path runs against real Workers AI embeddings/reranker and real D1/Vectorize with C# owner filtering; SUB-embedding-rerank-fixture is retired from the query path, and explicit lexical-only degradation is proven when the semantic path is unavailable.

### SRCH.90 — Owned artifacts, real integration and index capacity acceptance

**Outcome.** Every SRCH substep is built/packed once and consumed as exact candidate bytes from a clean environment; model04 launch-capacity.v1 account/realm vector and namespace budgets are enforced with reservation, old/new index overlap, tombstone reconciliation, threshold refusal before new paid admission, and rebuild pausing/recovery all proven.

| Field | Value |

| Entry condition | [ADOPT.07](adoption.md#task-adopt-07) — adoption of the owning repository is complete ([DLV-22](../README.md#rule-dlv-22)) |
| Completion prerequisites | **integration** [POL.02](policy.md#task-pol-02) — launch-capacity.v1 signed configuration snapshot. *Why:* capacity/threshold-refusal tests need the real signed budget document, not an invented number |
| Unblocks | [REL.06](release.md#task-rel-06), [SRCH.06](#task-srch-06) |
| Write scope | `Cloud:tests/Cloud.Tests.Integration/Retrieval/**` |
| Shared resources | [RES-private-configuration](../shared-resources.md#res-private-configuration) (append) |
| Validation | Package/contract/owner/version compatibility and failure/recovery tests; [P2-017](../../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) proportionate (no live paid-provider CI loop; capacity thresholds tested against recorded/replayable fixtures where the real CF budget document is unavailable in CI). |
| Completion evidence | Index capacity acceptance ledger: reservations, overlap, tombstone reconciliation, threshold refusal, rebuild pause/recovery. |
| Baseline (unreviewed unless accepted) | not-started Observed none, unreviewed: Cloud repo is Hello-World stage (src/ArcForges.Cloud only: Program.cs/HelloEndpoint.cs/BuildIdentity.cs/HealthStatus.cs); no Modules.* tree exists. |
| Notes | [WP-40](../../work-packages/40-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-wp-40) Sec.9 names 50/52 as downstream consumers of this released artifact; not a completion blocker for SRCH.90 itself. Contributes to [PG-26](../../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-26) (launch capacity envelope) as one of its producers. |
