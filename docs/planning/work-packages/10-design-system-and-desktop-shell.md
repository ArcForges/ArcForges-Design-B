# WP-10 — Design System and Desktop Shell Foundation

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Planning · Work package
> Phase: B — Shared platform
> Scheduling: this package is an obligation set; its delivery tasks and their typed prerequisites are listed in section 9, generated from the [delivery graph](../delivery/delivery-graph.json) under [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018).

> **Goal.** Build the shared desktop foundation once — tokens, windows, panels, commands, settings, attention, errors, lifecycle — so that three desktop products feel like one family without any of them depending on another, and so that every control in it survives Native AOT.

> **[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) execution binding.** Repositories: Platform; four applications. Inputs: only the applicable published producers available at this stage under [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration). Producer candidate records precede Cloud consolidation; no future package/manifest is an input. Source paths below resolve inside their assigned owner under [layout](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#root-and-logical-path-convention), never a shared checkout. Output: Native AOT candidate packages/executables with source SHA, package/descriptor/image/Worker identity and evidence attached to that artifact.
> After WP03, unit mocks consume published Contracts fixtures; earlier stages verify their inventory/policy outputs. Acceptance consumes the actual providers scheduled for that stage. A mock cannot close AOT, native isolation, device, CF/R2 or commercial live-operation gates.

## 1. Scope and purpose

**In scope.** The semantic token system, typography, density and motion; the window, panel and layout model; the command system and shortcut resolution; scoped settings; the attention and notification model; the error presentation model; application lifecycle and shutdown prompts; menus; and the shared-foundation boundary enforcement.

**Out of scope.** Any product's own screens. Account surfaces beyond the shared placeholder (`22`, `48`). Deep-link routing behaviour, which is `09`'s model rendered here.

**Why this package exists.** [SI-01](../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-si-01)–[SI-28](../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-si-28) describe a shared experience contract. Building it per product would produce four divergent shells and four sets of accessibility defects. It is placed after the AOT proof because every third-party control admitted here must pass the AOT gate (**[V-05a](../../assurance/phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-05a)**).

---

## 2. Required inputs and dependencies

[Producer artifacts and real integration](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) is a required input. Use this WP's row to identify exact released artifacts, permitted fixtures and the owner that must replace each fixture; completion requires the stated evidence class.


**Frozen architecture inputs.** [P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009), [package registry](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#12-package-and-native-distribution-registry), [numbered wire profile](../../architecture/contracts/04-protobuf-wire-registry.md), and [CF/state/object contract](../../architecture/contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md). All selected rules in these formal authorities apply before coding.

| Input | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| [`../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md`](../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md) | The full shared experience contract and invariants [SI-01](../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-si-01)–[SI-28](../../requirements/09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-si-28) |
| [`../../architecture/04-desktop-application-architecture.md`](../../architecture/04-desktop-application-architecture.md) | Host structure, MVVM, threading, windows, shell composition, start-up and shutdown |
| [`../../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md`](../../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md) `§4`, `§5`, `§10`, `§11` | Responsiveness, startup, accessibility and localisation contracts |
| **[V-05a](../../assurance/phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-05a)** | The third-party control AOT gate |
| [WP-06](06-aot-jit-and-wasm-publish-proof.md#rule-wp-06) output | The AOT proof and the control admission process |

## 3. Binding rules and decisions

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-br-01"></a>BR-01 | **The shared foundation contains mechanism, never product knowledge** (`§7` of the architecture overview). |
| <a id="rule-br-02"></a>BR-02 | **No product depends on another product** to render its own UI. |
| <a id="rule-br-03"></a>BR-03 | **Base ViewModel patterns are not shared with mobile** (**[D-021](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-021)**). |
| <a id="rule-br-04"></a>BR-04 | **Every third-party control requires its own AOT publish proof with zero diagnostics before adoption** (**[V-05a](../../assurance/phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-05a)**). |
| <a id="rule-br-05"></a>BR-05 | **Colour is never the only carrier of meaning**, and contrast, focus order and assistive-technology semantics are contract, not polish (`§10` of the quality contract). |
| <a id="rule-br-06"></a>BR-06 | **Every core workflow is completable by keyboard alone** ([AL-02](../../architecture/10-web-architecture.md#rule-al-02) in the web architecture; the desktop equivalent in `§10` there). |
| <a id="rule-br-07"></a>BR-07 | **Every user-visible string is localisable**, and no string is composed by concatenation that breaks under translation. |
| <a id="rule-br-08"></a>BR-08 | **Notifications are classified by durability, not severity alone.** A missed transient notification never loses durable attention state. |
| <a id="rule-br-09"></a>BR-09 | **Settings are scoped** — application, workspace, device, instance — and resolution order is fixed and explainable. |
| <a id="rule-br-10"></a>BR-10 | **Startup never blocks on the network or on sign-in** (`§27` of the quality contract). |
| <a id="rule-br-11"></a>BR-11 | **UI work happens on the UI thread; everything else does not** (`§3` of the desktop architecture). |

## 4. Projects, directories, files and major types affected

| Location | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/DesignSystem/ArcForges.DesignSystem/` | Created: semantic tokens, typography scale, density, motion, iconography, theming |
| `src/DesignSystem/ArcForges.Desktop.Shell/` | Created: windows, panels, layout, commands, settings, attention, errors, menus, lifecycle |
| `src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.Desktop.*` | Reconciled per [WP-01.02](01-repository-reconciliation-and-target-layout.md#rule-wp-01.02): mechanism-only survivors fold into the shell or the design system |
| `tests/DesktopExperienceTests/`, `tests/DesktopExperienceGallery/` | Extended: token coverage, command availability, shortcut conflicts, attention lifecycle |
| `tests/DesktopUiTests/` | Extended: keyboard-only workflow completion and assistive-technology semantics |

**Major types introduced.** `SemanticToken`, `ThemeDefinition`, `DensityMode`, `ShellWindow`, `PanelHost`, `LayoutState`, `CommandDefinition`, `CommandRegistry`, `ShortcutBinding`, `SettingScope`, `SettingResolver`, `AttentionItem`, `AttentionDurability`, `ErrorPresentation`, `LifecyclePrompt`, `MenuContribution`.

---

## 5. Required implementation work

<a id="rule-wp-10.00"></a>

### WP-10.00 — Token system and theming

**What must be fully done.** Semantic tokens for colour, typography, spacing, radius, elevation and motion, with light and dark themes and a high-contrast mode. No component references a raw value. Density modes are supported as a first-class capability rather than a scale factor.

**Testing requirements.** A policy test asserting no raw colour or size literal in component code; contrast tests across every theme; a density snapshot suite.

**Completion gate.** No raw literal survives, contrast passes in all themes, and density modes render correctly.

<a id="rule-wp-10.01"></a>

### WP-10.01 — Windows, panels and layout

**What must be fully done.** The window model with multiple windows per instance, the panel host with dockable, collapsible regions, and layout persistence that is device-local rather than synced work content. Layout restoration is resilient to a missing panel or a changed screen configuration.

**Testing requirements.** Restore tests across missing panel, changed display arrangement and corrupted layout state; a test asserting layout is device-local.

**Completion gate.** Layout restores safely in every degraded case and is never treated as synced work content.

<a id="rule-wp-10.02"></a>

### WP-10.02 — Command system

**What must be fully done.** A command registry with availability, shortcut binding, a command palette, and conflict detection. Availability is computed from the same evaluation the capability model uses ([WP-09.03](09-capability-contribution-and-resource-model.md#rule-wp-09.03)), so a command and a capability never disagree.

**Testing requirements.** Shortcut conflict detection; availability agreement tests against the capability model; palette search relevance tests.

**Completion gate.** No undetected shortcut conflict exists, and command availability agrees with capability availability.

<a id="rule-wp-10.03"></a>

### WP-10.03 — Scoped settings

**What must be fully done.** Settings with fixed scope resolution, typed schemas, migration on schema change, and an explainable effective value — the user can see which scope supplied a value. A device-scoped setting never syncs.

**Testing requirements.** Resolution order tests across every scope combination; explainability tests; a migration test.

**Completion gate.** Resolution order is correct and every effective value is explainable.

<a id="rule-wp-10.04"></a>

### WP-10.04 — Attention and notification model

**What must be fully done.** Attention items classified by durability. A durable item — a pending approval, a failed task — persists until resolved regardless of whether a transient notification was seen. Transient notifications are best-effort. Lock-screen and system-notification content is non-sensitive by default.

**Testing requirements.** A missed-notification test asserting durable state survives; a sensitivity test on notification content.

**Completion gate.** Missing every transient notification never loses a durable attention item.

<a id="rule-wp-10.05"></a>

### WP-10.05 — Error presentation

**What must be fully done.** Errors presented from the reason-code registry with a human-readable statement, what happened, whether it can be retried, and what the user can do. A raw exception message never reaches the user. A support reference identifier is available for every error.

**Testing requirements.** A test asserting no raw exception text is displayed; coverage that every registered reason code has a message.

**Completion gate.** No raw exception reaches the UI and every reason code has a presentation.

<a id="rule-wp-10.06"></a>

### WP-10.06 — Lifecycle, menus and shutdown

**What must be fully done.** Start-up sequence within the startup budget; single-instance routing; shutdown prompts that state consequences when work is running or unsaved; and menu contribution from the command registry.

**Testing requirements.** Startup budget measurement per product host; a shutdown-during-work test; a single-instance routing test.

**Completion gate.** Startup meets budget on reference hardware and shutdown never silently discards work.

<a id="rule-wp-10.07"></a>

### WP-10.07 — Accessibility and localisation baseline

**What must be fully done.** Every shell surface carries assistive-technology semantics, a correct focus order, and keyboard reachability. All strings are externalised. Right-to-left layout is supported structurally even if no such locale ships initially.

**Testing requirements.** Automated accessibility checks plus a dated manual assistive-technology verification; a pseudo-localisation pass; a right-to-left layout pass.

**Completion gate.** Automated checks pass, manual verification is recorded, and pseudo-localisation reveals no hard-coded or concatenated string.

<a id="rule-wp-10.08"></a>

### WP-10.08 — Third-party control admission

**What must be fully done.** Every third-party control the shell uses passes the AOT publish proof with zero diagnostics, and its licence position is recorded against the consuming boundary.

**Testing requirements.** A publish proof per control; a licence record per control.

**Completion gate.** Every admitted control has a zero-diagnostic AOT proof and a recorded licence position. **This satisfies [VG-03](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-03).**

---

<a id="rule-wp-10.90"></a>
### WP-10.90 — Verify the owned artifact and real integration

**What must be fully done.** Package shared Avalonia tokens, shell, commands, error/attention/settings and accessibility mechanisms; applications supply product flows. Do not turn shared UI into Web/Android or require a family installation.

**Execution order.** Follow [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration): consume only existing assigned producers, publish an owned capability candidate before its product consumer, and verify the declared stage against exact upstream artifacts. Record pending later owners and their closing gates; local mocks cover only that named test boundary.

**Testing requirements.** Each app restores only needed UI/mechanism packages and passes existing command, lifecycle and accessibility acceptance independently.

**Completion gate.** Each app restores only needed UI/mechanism packages and passes existing command, lifecycle and accessibility acceptance independently. Record exact artifacts and provider reality. The package is incomplete if an important contract/owner/recovery rule still requires design during coding.

## 6. Impacts

| Dimension | Impact |
|---|---|
| Database | Device-local layout and settings storage |
| Protocol | Command availability consumes the capability model |
| UI | This package *is* the shared UI foundation |
| Security | Notification sensitivity defaults; no secret in shell state |
| Platform | Per-platform window, menu, notification and shortcut conventions |
| Migration | Settings schema migration |
| Compatibility | Token and command contracts that product packages build against |

---

## 8. Completion gate

**[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) gate:** [WP-10.90](#rule-wp-10.90) and all inherited domain-specific gates must pass on the same candidate closure. Each app restores only needed UI/mechanism packages and passes existing command, lifecycle and accessibility acceptance independently.

**Offline evidence.** Execute this product's applicable [initial-state matrix](../../assurance/testing-and-verification-strategy.md#offline-acceptance-matrix) rows, including fresh shell, hydrated outage, unavailable content, signout and restart where applicable. Record permitted local work and explicitly unavailable Cloud actions.

**All of the following, with recorded evidence:**

1. No raw colour or size literal exists in component code; contrast passes in every theme including high contrast.
2. Layout restores safely under a missing panel, a changed display arrangement and corrupted state, and is device-local.
3. Shortcut conflicts are detected, and command availability agrees with capability availability.
4. Setting resolution order is correct and every effective value is explainable.
5. Missing every transient notification never loses a durable attention item.
6. No raw exception text reaches the UI, and every reason code has a presentation.
7. Startup meets budget on reference hardware; shutdown never silently discards work.
8. Accessibility checks pass with a dated manual verification, and pseudo-localisation reveals no hard-coded or concatenated string.
9. Every third-party control has a zero-diagnostic AOT proof and a recorded licence position — satisfying [VG-03](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-03).
