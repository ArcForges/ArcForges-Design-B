# WP-31 — Complete ArcChat Android Companion

> Status: Authoritative implementation plan under [P2-010](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-010)
> Phase: J — Platform and client integration
> Scheduling: this package is an obligation set; its delivery tasks and their typed prerequisites are listed in section 9, generated from the [delivery graph](../delivery/delivery-graph.json) under [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018).

## 1. Scope and purpose

Implement this stage of the complete Android ArcChat companion. [Mobile architecture](../../architecture/11-mobile-architecture.md), [client journeys](../../architecture/contracts/07-client-journeys-and-ports.md), [companion requirements](../../requirements/products/arcchat-mobile-and-web.md) and [producer stages](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) fix scope, behavior and evidence. Source repositories are implementation/reference evidence only; their hello scaffolds do not define completion.

## 2. Required inputs and dependencies

[Producer artifacts and real integration](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) is a required input. Use this WP's row to identify exact released artifacts, permitted fixtures and the owner that must replace each fixture; completion requires the stated evidence class.


Use the exact released Contracts Maven package/descriptor/fixture set, compatible Cloud/AI manifest and completed upstream owner outputs. Android toolchain and OS decisions come from Mobile architecture and WP06 proof; a blocking local toolchain/Android environment problem is reported before dependent execution. No producer source checkout or browser TS runtime is an input.

## 3. Binding rules and decisions

Android only, Kotlin/JVM/Jetpack Compose, Apache-2.0; no GPL-family implementation in the app. Command/owner/recovery identity, explicit permissions/consent, exact values, immutable producer artifacts, full accepted companion scope and consumption-only commercial restrictions are mandatory. [Wire registry](../../architecture/contracts/04-protobuf-wire-registry.md) owns the complete field and operation inventory. Equivalent internal classes/layout choices may vary only when observable behavior and acceptance remain identical.

## 4. Projects, directories, files and major types affected

Mobile owns app/, core/domain, core/data, core/network, core/security, core/designsystem, feature/home, feature/chat, feature/tasks, feature/library and feature/settings, tests and Android build/release governance. An equivalent module partition may preserve the same boundaries. No edits in other implementation repositories are required to bypass their published artifact boundary.

## 5. Required implementation work

<a id="rule-wp-31.00"></a>
### WP-31.00 — Authentication, Home and workspace

**What must be fully done.** Complete AN01–AN06 native routes, system authentication, five-destination navigation and per-device application selection, with real Cloud identity/presence and explicit history disclosure.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** All accepted account/attention paths complete and accessible; no hello-world scope substitution.

<a id="rule-wp-31.01"></a>
### WP-31.01 — Conversations and context

**What must be fully done.** Complete AN07–AN10/15/16 with native composer/IME/branch/context, history modes/promotion, real binary output streams and exact own-application scope; no desktop local-history access.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** Every conversation/project/retrieval row in Mobile architecture works with actual 52 owner outputs.

<a id="rule-wp-31.02"></a>
### WP-31.02 — Tasks, approvals and automation

**What must be fully done.** Complete AN11–AN13/19/25 against real Task/bridge/Harness/commerce; preserve current action, risk, credit-consent and consumption-only rules.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** One actual owner outcome/settlement per command, no broad implicit grant or hidden background write.

<a id="rule-wp-31.03"></a>
### WP-31.03 — Library and resources

**What must be fully done.** Complete AN14–AN18/22 native preview/import/export/transfers, missing/denied/unsupported states, local/cloud copy and deletion semantics.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** All resource/Library journeys complete; no unavailable bytes represented as empty success.

<a id="rule-wp-31.04"></a>
### WP-31.04 — Presence, push, links and settings

**What must be fully done.** Complete AN20–AN24 plus FCM/current permissions and one-application targets; background reconnect reads durable attention and cannot expose a revoked resource.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** Companion stays usable through declared polling/notification fallback; purchase/store billing remains absent.

<a id="rule-wp-31.05"></a>
### WP-31.05 — Native interaction and recovery

**What must be fully done.** Pass full experience 02 phone/tablet/back/IME/TalkBack/large-text/process-death/account-switch/denied-permission/no-GMS matrix with real services; preserve typed effect uncertainty and drafts.

**Testing requirements.** Verify the stated behavior against the exact real artifact/owner boundary. Include scope/permission, wrong or stale target, loss/retry, expiry and applicable native UI cases from experience 03; named later-provider fixtures cannot close real integration.

**Completion gate.** Real 52/26/25 evidence passes on release APK; mocks do not close any required journey.

<a id="rule-wp-31.06"></a>
### WP-31.06 — Scope and licence enforcement

**What must be fully done.** Check all companion requirements, consumption-only restrictions, public Maven-only imports and absence of desktop secrets, device-local paths or excluded professional editing surfaces. Validate all third-party code provenance.

**Testing requirements.** Package content/dependency/privacy checks and complete surface action inventory cross-check.

**Completion gate.** Required scope is complete; Android licence and commerce boundary hold without removing accepted behavior.

<a id="rule-wp-31.90"></a>
### WP-31.90 — Complete companion acceptance

**What must be fully done.** Join actual 31 evidence with producer manifests, signed candidate and full 52/26/25/42/45 compatible integration manifest.

**Testing requirements.** Run full physical-device release scenarios and injected failure matrix; record exact device/OS/server/worker/package identities.

**Completion gate.** Companion behavior passes; distribution/store activation remains 32.

## 6. Impacts

Contracts delivers the complete public Kotlin package; Cloud/AI deliver the same owner behavior as desktop/Web. Mobile maintains its own lifecycle/storage/UI. Changes in package/signing/schema versions require an explicit compatible manifest and tested migration.

## 7. Tests and verification evidence

Separate unit/schema/fixture tests, clean packaged consumers, actual Cloud/CF/desktop interactions, physical-device release evidence and distribution/store evidence. Record exact hashes/versions/device identity and limitations. A green build cannot substitute for a missing stage.


| Evidence | Produced by |
|---|---|
| Owned artifact and real-integration receipt: source commit, producer version, candidate hashes, actual runtime/OS/device/provider, scenario, result, limitations and real-versus-fixture status; inapplicable fields explicitly marked | [WP-31.90](#rule-wp-31.90) |

## 8. Completion gate

[PG-24](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-24): exercise the actual WP45.09 sender and push.v1 on a physical arm64 Android device, including Doze/background generic attention, authoritative detail/approval, duplicate suppression, rotation/revocation, no-GMS and denied-permission foreground recovery. Provider acceptance alone is insufficient.

Every numbered substep and applicable inherited requirement passes; the complete surface/action/state matrix is exercised. Unfinished required behavior blocks completion. Candidate and producer identities are immutable and all temporary fixtures have the named replacement stage. No scope reduction or design decision is deferred to consumer coding.

## 9. Dependencies
