# WP-43 — Workers AI Routing and Metering

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Planning · Work package
> Phase: J — Platform completion
> Scheduling: this package is an obligation set; its delivery tasks and their typed prerequisites are listed in section 9, generated from the [delivery graph](../delivery/delivery-graph.json) under [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018).

> **Goal.** Replace the stubbed provider path with the real one: provider routing under **operator-funded credentials**, dispatch-time supplier prices and Run-pinned customer tariffs, real usage normalisation, metering that reserves before and settles after, transparency obligations, and honest failure when a provider is unavailable.

> **[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) execution binding.** Repositories: AI Workers AI adapter + Cloud metering. Inputs: only the applicable published producers available at this stage under [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration). Producer candidate records precede Cloud consolidation; no future package/manifest is an input. Source paths below resolve inside their assigned owner under [layout](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#root-and-logical-path-convention), never a shared checkout. Output: owned candidate artifacts and generated contracts with source SHA, package/descriptor/image/Worker identity and evidence attached to that artifact.
> After WP03, unit mocks consume published Contracts fixtures; earlier stages verify their inventory/policy outputs. Acceptance consumes the actual providers scheduled for that stage. A mock cannot close AOT, native isolation, device, CF/R2 or commercial live-operation gates.

---

## 1. Scope and purpose

**In scope.** Cloud provider adapters and routing under operator-funded credentials; model and provider availability as policy; supplier price versions and Run-pinned customer tariffs; real usage normalisation into non-overlapping categories; settlement and the three ledgers; the provider interaction record; metering integrated with credits; **operator-funded provider credential custody and the structural absence of any end-user key path** ([WP-43.03](#rule-wp-43.03); [AI-02](../../requirements/products/arcchat.md#rule-ai-02) of the AI requirements; [ON-03](../../requirements/products/arcchat.md#rule-on-03) of the ArcChat requirements); AI transparency obligations; and failure handling when providers degrade.

**Out of scope.** The sole Harness itself (`52`). Retrieval (`40`). Commercial policy authoring (`42`).

**Why this package exists.** WP17 implements the fixture-backed AI client and WP42 the actual economic kernel. This package supplies real CF model adapters and persistent intent/outcome/metering ports for WP40/52, including the accepted ASR profile and transparency evidence.

---

## 2. Required inputs and dependencies

[Producer artifacts and real integration](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) is a required input. Use this WP's row to identify exact released artifacts, permitted fixtures and the owner that must replace each fixture; completion requires the stated evidence class.


**Frozen architecture inputs.** [P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009), [package registry](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#12-package-and-native-distribution-registry), [numbered wire profile](../../architecture/contracts/04-protobuf-wire-registry.md), and [CF/state/object contract](../../architecture/contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md). All selected rules in these formal authorities apply before coding.

**Frozen design input.** [content-origin behavior](../../requirements/07-security-privacy-and-trust.md#content-origin-profile) and [carrier schema](../../requirements/13-data-formats-and-portability.md#content-origin-carriers) is fixed before this package; implement it without choosing a different marking mechanism.

[WP-25](25-sync-engine-and-blob-lifecycle.md#rule-wp-25) provides authoritative Chat/Notes stores and durable output/resource commits; [WP-42](42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42) provides money/capacity admission; [WP-44](44-dynamic-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-wp-44) provides active route/policy snapshots. Single-invocation integration is tested here through those real ports without implementing a second Harness; [WP-52](52-cloud-harness.md#rule-wp-52) composes the loop.

| Input | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| [`../../requirements/05-ai-and-agent-execution.md`](../../requirements/05-ai-and-agent-execution.md) `§13` | AI economics: tariff versioning, cost dimensions, routing, three ledgers, transparency |
| [`../../architecture/09-ai-and-agent-runtime-architecture.md`](../../architecture/09-ai-and-agent-runtime-architecture.md) `§6`, `§7` | Provider routing and metering architecture |
| **[V-01](../../assurance/phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-01)** | The AI transparency gate and its trigger |
| **[D-020](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020)** | Versioned economic policy, immutable history, hard stop at zero |
| [WP-42](42-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-wp-42) output | Real budget/credit/admission ports; native ProductJobs do not provide AI economics |

## 3. Binding rules and decisions

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-br-01"></a>BR-01 | **Every run locks a tariff snapshot at start**; a rate change never alters a settled charge (**[D-020](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020)**). |
| <a id="rule-br-02"></a>BR-02 | **Credits are reserved before execution and settled after**, with a hard stop at zero (**[D-020](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-020)**). |
| <a id="rule-br-03"></a>BR-03 | **The three ledgers stay separate** ([I-011](../../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-011)): provider cost, customer credit, payment and revenue. |
| <a id="rule-br-04"></a>BR-04 | Workers AI calls use the AI binding in the CF deployment. C#/CF service authentication and other designated provider secrets remain in their owning deployment secret stores; never in images, policy values, public samples or clients. |
| <a id="rule-br-05"></a>BR-05 | **There is no end-user BYOK** ([BY-01](../../requirements/04-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-by-01)–[BY-04](../../requirements/04-commerce-entitlement-and-credits.md#rule-by-04), [I-015](../../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-015) retired). Provider credentials are deployment secrets ([DC-15](../../requirements/11-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-dc-15)); a self-host operator provisioning server credentials is infrastructure provisioning, not customer BYOK ([I-495](../../requirements/01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-495)). |
| <a id="rule-br-06"></a>BR-06 | Policy may activate only models/capabilities in the selected Workers AI catalogue/profile. Withdrawal produces an explicit unavailable state; an unvalidated model is not admitted by changing a string. |
| <a id="rule-br-07"></a>BR-07 | **Provider interaction records are a separate trace system** from execution, capability and audit traces. |
| <a id="rule-br-08"></a>BR-08 | **Hidden model reasoning never enters the product model.** |
| <a id="rule-br-09"></a>BR-09 | **Cost transparency is a product obligation**: a user can see what a run cost and why. |
| <a id="rule-br-10"></a>BR-10 | Provider failure before dispatch releases unused reservations; possible dispatch/outcome loss retains the existing unknown-usage hold/reconciliation deadline. No outage is silently treated as free, charged twice or safely replayable. |
| <a id="rule-br-11"></a>BR-11 | **AI-generated content carries the transparency marking the applicable regime requires** (**[V-01](../../assurance/phase-1-official-verification.md#rule-v-01)**). |

## 4. Projects, directories, files and major types affected

| Owner / location | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| AI: src/providers/workers-ai/, src/inference/ | Selected Workers AI catalogue adapter, model/text/embedding/rerank request/response normalization and service ports |
| Cloud: src/Cloud/ArcForges.Cloud.Modules.Agent/ | Catalogue/policy validation, routing decision, intent/outcome/usage/supplier records |
| Cloud: Modules.Task, Modules.Commerce, Modules.Entitlement | Their owned run, tariff, reservation, credit/settlement and audit transaction participants |
| Contracts: public Agent/usage and internal AI HTTP profiles | Generated types and independent fixtures from the fixed registry |
| Cloud/AI integration tests | Real provider capability, usage, unknown outcome, tariff, funding and recovery evidence |

The provider implementation is confined to ArcForges-AI; C# owns canonical commerce/authority and typed integration ports. No desktop/mobile model SDK or second loop is introduced.

## 5. Required implementation work

<a id="rule-wp-43.00"></a>

### WP-43.00 — Provider adapters and routing


**What must be fully done.** Implement only the selected Workers AI catalogue/capability profiles using env.AI.run: default/fast text, accepted image context, bge-m3 embedding, reranker and slate.transcribe.v1 Whisper ASR. Validate model availability and frozen config, canonical request limits and supported tool/stream shapes before dispatch. C# records admission/routing and supplier version; CF executes the already admitted intent.

**Testing requirements.** Actual selected models/capability shapes, withdrawn/unknown/unsupported requests, request-size/output bounds and version mismatch.

**Completion gate.** The validated CF catalogue supplies every accepted AI call kind; no external provider, BYOK, Gateway or Node sidecar is required.

<a id="rule-wp-43.01"></a>

### WP-43.01 — Tariffs and cost dimensions

**What must be fully done.** Versioned tariffs with effective dates and the full cost-dimension set. Each run locks a tariff snapshot at start. A historical charge is explainable against the rates in force at the time. Media units are metered separately from text units.

**Testing requirements.** A rate-change test asserting settled charges are unaffected; an explainability test reconstructing a historical charge; per-dimension metering tests.

**Completion gate.** A rate change never alters a settled charge, and every historical charge is explainable from its locked snapshot.

<a id="rule-wp-43.02"></a>

### WP-43.02 — Metering and settlement


**What must be fully done.** Implement C# reservation/intent before CF I/O, outcome receipt before settlement and immutable attempt usage revisions under the existing transaction families. Cover interactive runs and bounded inference jobs; operator maintenance remains separately funded. Use stable attempt identity, supplier exposure, Run customer total and exact credit lots. Unknown usage follows its existing deadline/liability ladder, never an automatic model resend.

**Testing requirements.** Actual CF normal/interrupted/lost outcome with concurrent duplicates and replayed receipts; cancelled/unknown hold sweep, tariff change and operator-job isolation.

**Completion gate.** Each possible invocation is accounted once; holds and unknown liability reconcile without duplicate effect or unapproved spend.

<a id="rule-wp-43.03"></a>

### WP-43.03 — Selected supplier and realm routing

**What must be fully done.** Use Workers AI binding and explicit admitted model catalogue only; no AI Gateway/multiprovider bypass/fallback. Self-host uses operator-owned model/search credentials and funding, payment disabled by default.

**Testing requirements.** Unavailable/withdrawn model, missing price/config, pre-dispatch refusal vs unknown dispatch and explicit new-model request.

**Completion gate.** No silent substitution or token/credit crossing between official/self-host realms.

<a id="rule-wp-43.04"></a>

### WP-43.04 — Provider interaction records and transparency

**Required design implementation and verification.** Implement the already frozen content-origin profile at the provider generation boundary. Test real provider text through durable output and downstream carrier fixtures, deterministic/non-AI and legacy controls, malformed/hash-mismatched mark and marking retry. Supplier usage remains recorded; platform non-delivery releases/compensates customer funding under existing metering rules. Record the separate [VG-01](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-01) regime/adequacy approval before its market trigger.

**What must be fully done.** A provider interaction record per call, separate from the execution, capability and audit traces, carrying no content beyond what policy permits. Cost transparency surfaces show what a run cost and why. AI-generated content carries the required transparency marking per artifact type.

**Testing requirements.** Trace-separation test; a content-redaction test on interaction records; a cost-explainability test; a marking-coverage test per artifact type.

**Completion gate.** Interaction records are separate and redacted, run cost is explainable to the user, and every artifact type has a defined marking. **This satisfies [VG-01](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-01) once the regime determination is recorded.**

<a id="rule-wp-43.05"></a>

### WP-43.05 — Funding and uncertain outcome proof

**What must be fully done.** Implement supplier intent/exposure and customer settlement independently. Brave search is operator-funded; processing search results is customer inference. Aggregate Workers AI billing never proves an individual request outcome.

**Testing requirements.** Search without customer debit, model debit once, crash before/after dispatch, unknown deadline, late usage after closed-no-later-debit and no automatic model retry.

**Completion gate.** Real selected supplier adapter and deterministic ledger vectors preserve uncertainty and all budget boundaries.

<a id="rule-wp-43.07"></a>

### WP-43.07 — Real-provider metering evidence


**What must be fully done.** Record actual Workers AI responses for each selected capability and normalize them into independent sanitized fixtures. Run deterministic fixtures on ordinary CI and the credentialed real-CF candidate gate with exact Worker/model/config identities; fixtures never replace supplier/usage proof.

**Testing requirements.** Model response drift, missing category, cumulative stream and embedding/rerank result validation, plus controlled real-provider run.

**Completion gate.** The selected provider closure has both repeatable protocol tests and actual integration evidence.

<a id="rule-wp-43.06"></a>

### WP-43.06 — Provider test-environment coverage

**What must be fully done.** Every provider integration exercised against the provider's test environment, with its contract shape frozen as recorded fixtures so CI does not depend on provider availability.

**Testing requirements.** A per-provider test-environment run; a fixture-driven CI run with the provider unreachable.

**Completion gate.** Every provider is exercised against its test environment and has recorded fixtures — **satisfying [PG-10](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-10) for AI providers**.

---

**Required implementation and closure from the final review.** Implement and independently verify [05-cloudflare-integration](../../architecture/contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md#9-job-authorized-objects-control-inventory-and-resource-budgets). Use real Workers AI Whisper plus typed audio manifests/service object grants; verify supplier metering against actual response/manifest with missing usage retained uncertain. Implement inference-late-outcome evidence-only reconciliation, exact observed versions and bounded Workflow limits. Stale results cannot publish or charge the customer. Record exact artifact identities and real/fixture status with the existing substeps; these cases are part of this package's completion gate.

<a id="rule-wp-43.90"></a>
### WP-43.90 — Verify the owned artifact and real integration

**What must be fully done.** Assemble the owned deliverables from the preceding substeps under the selected repository, package, runtime and protocol authorities. Implement the frozen Workers AI model subset/direct binding, capability matrix, normalization, limits and known/unknown usage contract. Gateway is not a required dependency.

**Execution order.** Follow [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration): consume only existing assigned producers, publish an owned capability candidate before its product consumer, and verify the declared stage against exact upstream artifacts. Record pending later owners and their closing gates; local mocks cover only that named test boundary.

**Testing requirements.** Real selected model/tool/embedding cases and provider refusal/lost-result/usage reconciliation, tied to C# admitted call and config identity. No general external-provider integration implied.

**Completion gate.** Real selected model/tool/embedding cases and provider refusal/lost-result/usage reconciliation, tied to C# admitted call and config identity. No general external-provider integration implied. Record exact artifacts and provider reality. The package is incomplete if an important contract/owner/recovery rule still requires design during coding.

## 6. Impacts

| Dimension | Impact |
|---|---|
| Database | Tariffs, interaction records and metering results |
| Protocol | AI request, response and metering contracts |
| UI | Model selection, cost transparency and availability surfaces |
| Security | Operator credential custody by secret injection ([DC-15](../../requirements/11-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-dc-15)); egress control on model interaction; instruction provenance on model output |
| Platform | **No local model support** ([C-02](../../requirements/00-product-scope-and-portfolio.md#rule-c-02)). Provider availability and route health are surfaced honestly |
| Migration | Tariff and interaction record schema versioning |
| Compatibility | AI contracts enter the supported window |

---

## 7. Tests and verification evidence

Acceptance includes every amended §5 producer/consumer and [WP-43.90](#rule-wp-43.90) evidence. Current [P2-013](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-013) contracts/data/runtime rules are tested in the original owner implementation, not a detached explanatory sample.

**Required evidence addition.** [WP-43.04](#rule-wp-43.04) records the carrier/propagation/failure vectors above with payload and manifest hashes; early packages use declared fixtures, while provider/Harness packages require their real integrations.

| Evidence | Produced by |
|---|---|
| Routing decision, explainability and streaming results | [WP-43.00](#rule-wp-43.00) |
| Rate-change immutability and historical explainability results | [WP-43.01](#rule-wp-43.01) |
| Metering accounting, idempotency, sweep and overdraft results | [WP-43.02](#rule-wp-43.02) |
| No-BYOK structural assertions and credential-custody results | [WP-43.03](#rule-wp-43.03) |
| Real-provider normalisation, settlement and worked-fixture results | [WP-43.07](#rule-wp-43.07) |
| Trace separation, redaction, cost explainability and marking coverage | [WP-43.04](#rule-wp-43.04) |
| Degradation, reservation release and alert results | [WP-43.05](#rule-wp-43.05) |
| Per-provider test-environment runs and fixture-driven CI results | [WP-43.06](#rule-wp-43.06) |
| Owned artifact and real-integration receipt: source commit, producer version, candidate hashes, actual runtime/OS/device/provider, scenario, result, limitations and real-versus-fixture status; inapplicable fields explicitly marked | [WP-43.90](#rule-wp-43.90) |

---

## 8. Completion gate

**[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) gate:** [WP-43.90](#rule-wp-43.90) and all inherited domain-specific gates must pass on the same candidate closure. Real selected model/tool/embedding cases and provider refusal/lost-result/usage reconciliation, tied to C# admitted call and config identity. No general external-provider integration implied.

**[PG-13](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-13) evidence:** [WP-43.07](#rule-wp-43.07) — Real provider usage and exact synthetic supplier/customer settlement fixture through production code; combine with payment/term evidence from package 42. A scoped contribution does not close the shared gate until every required producer has recorded passing evidence at its trigger.

**Additional completion requirement.** The package's content paths pass the stated origin vectors, including unknown input and failed publication; a valid stored/rendered payload alone cannot satisfy the carrier requirement.

**All of the following, with recorded evidence:**

1. Routing is policy-driven, explainable and recorded; streaming interruption never stores a partial response as complete.
2. A rate change never alters a settled charge; every historical charge is explainable from its locked tariff snapshot.
3. Metering never double-charges, never leaks a reservation, and never permits an overdraft under concurrency.
4. **No end-user BYOK path exists anywhere in the product** — no operation, schema field, setting or UI accepts a customer provider key — and Workers AI executes only through the provisioned CF binding, with direction-scoped C#/CF service keys and no credentials in clients.
5. Provider interaction records are a separate, redacted trace system; run cost is explainable to the user; every artifact type has a defined transparency marking — satisfying [VG-01](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-vg-01) once the regime determination is recorded.
6. A provider outage never silently consumes credit; a withdrawn model degrades with a stated reason; all-routes-unavailable alerts.
7. Every provider is exercised against its test environment with recorded fixtures — satisfying [PG-10](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-10) for AI providers.

## [P2-010](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-010) required behavior and closure

Model intent/outcome/settlement supports real ExecutionOwner task/turn and operator-funded compaction/search. Temporary bodies stay outside durable D1 and SQLite history, backups and Workflow checkpoints; durable receipts keep actual supplier/customer facts. The referenced normative profile and producer stage matrix are binding inputs. Record independent positive/negative vectors and actual owner integration at this WP's assigned stage; a mock cannot close a real-provider/device requirement.
