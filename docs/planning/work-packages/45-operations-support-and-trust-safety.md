# WP-45 — Operations, Support and Trust & Safety

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Planning · Work package
> Phase: J — Platform completion
> Scheduling: this package is an obligation set; its delivery tasks and their typed prerequisites are listed in section 9, generated from the [delivery graph](../delivery/delivery-graph.json) under [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018).

> **Goal.** Make the platform operable: alerting that is worth waking someone for, runbooks that have actually been executed, a status page that survives an outage, support access that never silently impersonates a user, and an enforcement ladder with appeals.

> **[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) execution binding.** Repositories: Cloud APIs; Web operator/status surfaces; AI emitters. Inputs: only the applicable published producers available at this stage under [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration). Producer candidate records precede Cloud consolidation; no future package/manifest is an input. Source paths below resolve inside their assigned owner under [layout](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#root-and-logical-path-convention), never a shared checkout. Output: owned candidate artifacts and generated contracts with source SHA, package/descriptor/image/Worker identity and evidence attached to that artifact.
> After WP03, unit mocks consume published Contracts fixtures; earlier stages verify their inventory/policy outputs. Acceptance consumes the actual providers scheduled for that stage. A mock cannot close AOT, native isolation, device, CF/R2 or commercial live-operation gates.

---

## 1. Scope and purpose

**In scope.** Alerting and severity; the incident process; runbook authoring and rehearsal; the independently hosted status page; service-level objectives and their computation; the operator console with its separate identity system; support cases and time-bounded support access; break-glass; community reports and the enforcement ladder; appeals; security advisories; and operational email adapters.

**Out of scope.** Backup and disaster recovery (`46`). Observability instrumentation (`12`).

**Why this package exists.** [the current dependency model](../implementation-sequence.md#2-phase-structure) places operations, support and trust and safety in cloud completion. The cloud go-live threshold is "failure behaves correctly", and that threshold cannot be met without this package.

---

## 2. Required inputs and dependencies

[Producer artifacts and real integration](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) is a required input. Use this WP's row to identify exact released artifacts, permitted fixtures and the owner that must replace each fixture; completion requires the stated evidence class.


**Frozen architecture inputs.** [P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009), [package registry](../../architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#12-package-and-native-distribution-registry), [numbered wire profile](../../architecture/contracts/04-protobuf-wire-registry.md), and [CF/state/object contract](../../architecture/contracts/05-cloudflare-integration.md). All selected rules in these formal authorities apply before coding.

| Input | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| [`../../architecture/13-observability-and-operations.md`](../../architecture/13-observability-and-operations.md) | Alerting, incidents, status, operator surface, runbooks, dependency adapters |
| [`../../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md`](../../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md) Part II | Support, operators, recovery, incidents, enforcement, appeals, advisories |
| [`../../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md`](../../requirements/products/arcforges-cloud.md) `§9` | Service levels, incident severity and the required runbook set |
| [WP-12](12-observability-foundation.md#rule-wp-12), [WP-21](21-cloud-host-and-persistence.md#rule-wp-21), [WP-44](44-dynamic-policy-and-configuration.md#rule-wp-44) output | Signals, the real cloud and the policy control plane |

## 3. Binding rules and decisions

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-br-01"></a>BR-01 | **Alerts are symptom-based.** A single unexpected exception is a defect signal, not a page. |
| <a id="rule-br-02"></a>BR-02 | **Every alert names its runbook.** An alert without a runbook is not deployed. |
| <a id="rule-br-03"></a>BR-03 | **A runbook is executable in an incident** and is exercised, not merely written. |
| <a id="rule-br-04"></a>BR-04 | **The status page is hosted independently of ArcForges Cloud**, with an emergency alternate URL published. |
| <a id="rule-br-05"></a>BR-05 | **Status components are user-facing capabilities**, never internal vendors or regions. |
| <a id="rule-br-06"></a>BR-06 | **An operator never silently becomes a user.** Support access is explicit, consented where required, time-bounded, scoped and audited. |
| <a id="rule-br-07"></a>BR-07 | **Break-glass is a distinct, alarmed path** with mandatory justification, automatic expiry and post-hoc review. |
| <a id="rule-br-08"></a>BR-08 | **Operator actions are audited to the audit system**, never only to telemetry. |
| <a id="rule-br-09"></a>BR-09 | **A possible personal-data breach is automatically the highest severity**, with the statutory notification clock as a hard deadline. |
| <a id="rule-br-10"></a>BR-10 | **The enforcement ladder is proportionate and appealable**, with every action recorded and communicated. |
| <a id="rule-br-11"></a>BR-11 | **Security advisories follow a defined disclosure process** coordinated with the expedited update path. |
| <a id="rule-br-12"></a>BR-12 | **Transactional and broadcast email are separated by stream and sending subdomain**, and security-critical email has a prepared secondary path. |

---

## 4. Projects, directories, files and major types affected

| Location | Change |
|---|---|
| Cloud `src/Modules/{Support,TrustSafety,Audit,Policy,Configuration,PackageCatalog}/<Name>.{Domain,Application,Infrastructure}` | Existing domain owners implement support/access, enforcement, proposals/audit, controls, configuration and catalog; Cloud.Host composes OperatorService. There is no unowned Operations persistence module. |
| Cloud `src/Modules/Notification/Notification.{Domain,Application,Infrastructure}` | Transactional and broadcast email adapters with separated streams and a secondary path |
| Web `apps/app` (operations profile) | The operator console on its own origin and identity system |
| `deploy/monitoring/` | Alert definitions, service-level objective definitions, status component mapping |
| `docs/runbooks/` in the implementation repository | The required runbook set with rehearsal records |
| `tests/CloudIntegrationTests/Operations/` | Alert-to-runbook, support access, break-glass, enforcement and appeal suites |

**Major types introduced.** `AlertDefinition`, `Severity`, `Incident`, `IncidentState`, `Runbook`, `RunbookRehearsal`, `ServiceLevelObjective`, `ServiceLevelIndicator`, `StatusComponent`, `OperatorIdentity`, `OperatorScope`, `SupportCase`, `SupportAccessGrant`, `BreakGlassSession`, `EnforcementAction`, `AppealRequest`, `SecurityAdvisory`.

## 5. Required implementation work

<a id="rule-wp-45.00"></a>

### WP-45.00 — Service levels and alerting

**What must be fully done.** Service-level indicators measuring user-visible success, objectives per capability group with realtime and managed AI computed independently, error-budget visibility, and the enumerated page-worthy alert set with routing that distinguishes page, ticket and dashboard.

**Testing requirements.** Indicator correctness against synthetic failures; a dependency-attribution test asserting a provider outage does not read as full platform downtime; an alert-routing test; an alert-to-runbook completeness assertion.

**Completion gate.** Indicators measure user-visible success, a provider outage is attributed correctly, and **every deployed alert names an existing runbook**.

<a id="rule-wp-45.01"></a>

### WP-45.01 — Incident process

**What must be fully done.** The four-severity ladder shared by engineering, support and communication; incident state tracked in a system independent of production; a possible personal-data breach automatically the highest severity with the statutory clock treated as a hard deadline; post-incident review producing runbook updates.

**Testing requirements.** A severity-classification exercise; an independence assertion for the incident system; a breach-classification test.

**Completion gate.** Severity is shared and unambiguous, the incident system survives a production outage, and a possible breach classifies automatically at the highest severity.

<a id="rule-wp-45.02"></a>

### WP-45.02 — Runbooks and rehearsal

**What must be fully done.** Every required runbook written with preconditions, decision points, exact steps, verification and rollback. Each is executed at least once with a dated record. A runbook never executed is marked unproven.

**Testing requirements.** A completeness check against the required set; a dated rehearsal record per runbook.

**Completion gate.** **Every runbook for an implemented owner has a dated rehearsal record; recovery/CF cases awaiting WP46/52 remain explicitly pending until WP50 joins them** — contributing to [PG-04](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-04).

<a id="rule-wp-45.03"></a>

### WP-45.03 — Status page

**What must be fully done.** An independently hosted status page with user-facing capability components, an emergency alternate URL published in the repository, support documentation and public profiles, and a mapping from internal capability health to published component state that is explicit and reviewed.

**Testing requirements.** A full-cloud-outage test asserting the status page remains available; a mapping test per capability health state; a vendor-name absence check.

**Completion gate.** The status page survives a full cloud outage, publishes only user-facing components, and its emergency alternate URL is published in at least three places.

<a id="rule-wp-45.04"></a>

### WP-45.04 — Operator console and support access

**What must be fully done.** The operator console on a separate origin with a separate identity system, never in public navigation. Support access is explicit, scoped, time-bounded, consented where required and audited. A destructive action affecting customer data or entitlement requires a second authorised operator. Operator tooling uses the same contracts as the product.

**Testing requirements.** A silent-impersonation negative test; scope and expiry tests; a two-operator requirement test; an audit-completeness test; a parallel-admin-API absence assertion. Exercise every generated role/method pair (allowed and refused), operator case reply/reopen, grant/revoke, positive/negative compensation, approval/read/retry UI and pending/unknown refund. Assert durable audit context and user-visible entitlement/billing explanation, and that one approved proposal cannot execute twice.

**Completion gate.** **An operator can never silently become a user**, every access is scoped, expiring and audited, and no parallel unversioned admin API exists.

<a id="rule-wp-45.05"></a>

### WP-45.05 — Break-glass

**What must be fully done.** A distinct, alarmed emergency access path with mandatory justification, automatic expiry, immediate alerting and mandatory post-hoc review. Break-glass use is visible to the account owner where it touched their data.

**Testing requirements.** Activation alerting; expiry enforcement; a review-requirement test; an owner-visibility test.

**Completion gate.** Break-glass alerts immediately, expires automatically, requires review, and is visible to the affected account owner.

<a id="rule-wp-45.06"></a>

### WP-45.06 — Support cases and in-product reporting

**What must be fully done.** In-product problem reporting producing a support reference without attaching data by default; support cases linking to diagnostic references rather than content; the case lifecycle with response expectations.

**Testing requirements.** A no-data-by-default assertion; a reference-resolution test; a lifecycle test.

**Completion gate.** A problem report attaches no user data by default and produces a resolvable support reference.

<a id="rule-wp-45.07"></a>

### WP-45.07 — Trust and safety

**What must be fully done.** Community report intake; the proportionate enforcement ladder with every action recorded and communicated; account enforcement states integrated with the account model; an appeal process with a defined path and response expectation; copyright and public content handling.

**Testing requirements.** Ladder progression tests; a communication-completeness assertion; an appeal path test; an enforcement-audit test.

**Completion gate.** Every enforcement action is proportionate, recorded, communicated and appealable.

<a id="rule-wp-45.08"></a>

### WP-45.08 — Operational mail and provider drills

**What must be fully done.** Use WP22 real Postmark/SES adapters; add console metrics/runbooks, outage/reconciliation drills and prepared secondary validation under arch 13. Select status/incident/telemetry/analytics against its fixed criteria and record actual providers. Retain private security advisory intake, triage, assigned remediation, signed public advisory publication and in-product containment/revocation attention; mail adapter relocation to WP22 does not remove these TrustSafety obligations.

**Testing requirements.** Unknown send, spoofed/replayed callback, bounced/complained suppression, DNS readiness, independent status/incident during Cloud outage and content-redaction tests. Verify private-report access, signed advisory authenticity, affected-version matching and no disclosure before approved publication.

**Completion gate.** Live operational evidence and rollback contacts exist; this step is not the first email producer. Security advisory intake through publication and affected-client attention is complete.

<a id="rule-wp-45.09"></a>

### WP-45.09 — Customer push delivery and registration lifecycle

**What must be fully done.** Implement Notification IPushSender, typed FCM HTTP v1 credential adapter, unique delivery intents/outbox, generation/revocation checks and exact push.v1 profile. Preserve current business transactions and durable attention independently of sending.

**Testing requirements.** Live isolated Firebase project send and recorded invalid-token/payload/project/rate-limit responses; token rotation race, crash-after-acceptance duplicates, TTL expiry, revoke-before-send and no secret logging. WP32 provides physical receipt.

**Completion gate.** Actual sender works with bounded/fenced recovery; provider acceptance is labeled separately from device delivery. [PG-24](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-24) remains open until WP32 physical/no-GMS/permission evidence.

<a id="rule-wp-45.10"></a>

### WP-45.10 — Package review and revocation console

**What must be fully done.** Integrate existing WP41 PackageCatalog operator methods with independent operator authentication, step-up/evidence and audit. Show asynchronous signed-index publication state.

**Testing requirements.** Customer/PAT denial, changed proposal hash, replay, revoked package and failed index publication/retry. Use internal GetCatalogSubmission and the same typed proposal/approval path as the generated operator matrix; production catalog read-only views cannot grant operator mutation authority.

**Completion gate.** Review decisions and revocations affect real signed catalog consumers with recorded operator evidence.

<a id="rule-wp-45.90"></a>
### WP-45.90 — Verify the owned artifact and real integration

**What must be fully done.** Assign frontend ownership to Web and backend authority to Cloud. Add CF execution/model/R2 status, correlated incident traces, support permissions and outage actions to existing operational workflows.

**Execution order.** Follow [staged artifact integration](../README.md#staged-artifact-integration): consume only existing assigned producers, publish an owned capability candidate before its product consumer, and verify the declared stage against exact upstream artifacts. Record pending later owners and their closing gates; local mocks cover only that named test boundary.

**Testing requirements.** Actual role/redaction/status/support cases and actionable CF/R2 failure diagnostics; no second Node/operations business host.

**Completion gate.** Actual role/redaction/status/support cases and actionable CF/R2 failure diagnostics; no second Node/operations business host. Record exact artifacts and provider reality. The package is incomplete if an important contract/owner/recovery rule still requires design during coding.

---

**Producer prerequisites.** WP45.08 consumes WP22 real mail artifacts and its live-delivery/recovery record; it cannot be used to defer WP22’s gate. Runtime mail fixtures are absent. Recorded failures remain test-only.

**Operator contract closure.** Consume [registry04 §9](../../architecture/contracts/04-protobuf-wire-registry.md#9-operator-control-and-separate-identity-boundary) and [model01 operator state](../../architecture/data-model/01-cloud-data-model.md#operator-proposal-approval-and-financial-owner-closure). Generate/implement every operation exactly once with its eight authorization fields, operator scope and [OC-03](../../requirements/10-distribution-update-and-support.md#rule-oc-03) role binding. Public customer/PAT/agent access refuses. Verify distinct approver, stale hash/revision/configuration, role revocation, expiry, concurrent consumption and lost receipt; no direct SQL or public-SDK operator import. WP03 produces schema/negative vectors, WP23 real identity/dispatch conformance, WP42 the financial owners, WP44 configuration/policy owners, and WP45 the real console join. Earlier packages retain their named fixture boundary until the existing downstream join.

**Browser matrix acceptance.** Use [browser-support.v1](../../requirements/12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md#202-browser-supportv1) and the exact release artifact/OS/browser patches. For each output’s existing flows, verify supported/degraded/blocked browser behavior: delayed-stream polling where streaming exists, refusal of unavailable required authentication/step-up, safe-preview refusal and preserved pending work. Static site acceptance includes no-JavaScript readability; it does not invent interactive account/stream APIs. Operator step-up retains its separate Entra/MFA authority. WP23 proves generated transports; WP45/47/48/49 prove their respective operations/site/account/chat output; WP50 joins all four production hashes and real browser evidence. A Playwright WebKit run alone does not claim Safari/OS authenticator proof.

## 6. Impacts

| Dimension | Impact |
|---|---|
| Database | Support cases, access grants, enforcement actions and advisories |
| Protocol | Operator contracts reuse product contracts |
| UI | Operator console, support surfaces and status page |
| Security | Operator access is a major control surface; break-glass is alarmed |
| Platform | Status and incident systems independent of the platform they monitor |
| Migration | Operations schema versioning |
| Compatibility | Advisory and enforcement communication reaches every client version |

---

## 7. Tests and verification evidence

Acceptance includes every amended §5 producer/consumer and [WP-45.90](#rule-wp-45.90) evidence. Current [P2-013](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-013) contracts/data/runtime rules are tested in the original owner implementation, not a detached explanatory sample.

WP45.09 records live FCM sending, failure/rotation/generation vectors and credential/project identities without secrets; WP32 closes physical receipt under [PG-24](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-24).

| Evidence | Produced by |
|---|---|
| Indicator, attribution, routing and runbook-completeness results | [WP-45.00](#rule-wp-45.00) |
| Severity, independence and breach-classification results | [WP-45.01](#rule-wp-45.01) |
| Runbook completeness check and dated rehearsal records | [WP-45.02](#rule-wp-45.02) |
| Outage-survival, mapping and vendor-absence results | [WP-45.03](#rule-wp-45.03) |
| Impersonation negative, scope, two-operator and audit results | [WP-45.04](#rule-wp-45.04) |
| Break-glass alert, expiry, review and visibility results | [WP-45.05](#rule-wp-45.05) |
| No-data-by-default and reference resolution results | [WP-45.06](#rule-wp-45.06) |
| Ladder, communication, appeal and audit results | [WP-45.07](#rule-wp-45.07) |
| Advisory rehearsal and email failover results | [WP-45.08](#rule-wp-45.08) |
| Owned artifact and real-integration receipt: source commit, producer version, candidate hashes, actual runtime/OS/device/provider, scenario, result, limitations and real-versus-fixture status; inapplicable fields explicitly marked | [WP-45.90](#rule-wp-45.90) |

---

## 8. Completion gate

**[P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) gate:** [WP-45.90](#rule-wp-45.90) and all inherited domain-specific gates must pass on the same candidate closure. Actual role/redaction/status/support cases and actionable CF/R2 failure diagnostics; no second Node/operations business host.

**All of the following, with recorded evidence:**

1. Indicators measure user-visible success; a provider outage is attributed correctly; **every deployed alert names an existing runbook**.
2. Severity is shared and unambiguous; the incident system survives a production outage; a possible breach classifies automatically at the highest severity.
3. **Every runbook for an implemented owner has a dated rehearsal record; recovery/CF cases awaiting WP46/52 remain explicitly pending until WP50 joins them** — contributing to [PG-04](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-pg-04).
4. The status page survives a full cloud outage, publishes only user-facing components, and its emergency alternate URL is published in at least three places.
5. **An operator can never silently become a user**; every support access is scoped, expiring and audited; no parallel unversioned admin API exists.
6. Break-glass alerts immediately, expires automatically, requires post-hoc review, and is visible to the affected account owner.
7. A problem report attaches no user data by default and produces a resolvable support reference.
8. Every enforcement action is proportionate, recorded, communicated and appealable.
9. An advisory can be published and coordinated with an expedited update; **email failover produces no duplicate one-time codes**.
