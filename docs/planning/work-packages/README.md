# Work Packages

Execution follows [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018) and [P2-017](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-017) with the [CI/local policy](../../assurance/ci-and-local-validation-policy.md). Work packages are obligation sets; their delivery tasks run whenever their own prerequisites allow. Runtime scenarios are scoped local opt-in, not hosted CI or repeated post-merge gates; macOS CI is prohibited. Historical completion evidence is not a rerun requirement.

> Status: **Authoritative** — Phase 2 (Detailed Specifications)
> Layer: Planning
> Governing authority: **[D-017](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-017)** (numbered implementation work packages belong here), [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018) (task-level scheduling)
> Companions: [`../delivery/README.md`](../delivery/README.md), [`../implementation-sequence.md`](../implementation-sequence.md), [`../../assurance/release-gates.md`](../../assurance/release-gates.md), [`../../assurance/open-gates-register.md`](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md)

**51 active obligation packages are identified in `00`–`53`; `20` is future-only; `27` and `29` are retired.** Each package defines what must be done, tested and accepted. Scheduling is task-level: each package's section 9 lists the delivery tasks that satisfy it, generated from the [delivery graph](../delivery/delivery-graph.json), and [traceability](../delivery/traceability.md) maps every substep to its tasks.

The number is an identity, not a schedule. No package waits for another package; a task waits only for the specific tasks named in its prerequisites.

## Downstream dependency index

Retired by [P2-018](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-018). The package-level downstream index and its forward table described a serial package order; they remain in repository history as a record. Consumers of each package are now listed per task: each package's section 9 names the tasks outside the package that consume its tasks, and every lane catalogue lists what each task unblocks.

## Deferred-gate scheduling

Every gate in [`../../assurance/open-gates-register.md`](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md) is satisfied by a named package.

The contributing delivery tasks for each gate are listed in [gate traceability](../delivery/traceability.md#gates). A gate closes only when every contributing task has recorded its evidence.

## Conventions

- Each package is one file, `NN-slug.md`, and contains numbered substeps `WP-NN.MM`, each with what must be fully done, its testing requirement and its own completion gate.
- Every package states the nine mandatory fields listed in `§6` of [`../implementation-sequence.md`](../implementation-sequence.md); field 9 is the generated delivery-task block.
- Section 2 of each package lists the documents and upstream outputs its obligations consume. They are information inputs, not scheduling prerequisites: a task's prerequisites are only its typed edges in the delivery graph.
- A package's completion gate is machine-evaluated wherever possible and always names its evidence artifact; the package is complete when every task mapped to it is complete.
- A task that discovers a genuine architecture conflict stops and raises it (**[D-001](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-001)**); it does not resolve it locally.
- **A package never re-creates a completed baseline audit.** The reference matrices and the code inventory are versioned planning inputs; tasks consume them and check for drift ([`../evidence-driven-revisions.md`](../evidence-driven-revisions.md)).
- Implementation ownership is per task: any number of workers may execute different ready tasks concurrently under atomic claims, with merges coordinated by each repository's integration owner ([DLV-26](../delivery/README.md#rule-dlv-26), [DLV-29](../delivery/README.md#rule-dlv-29)).
- **A package identifier is stable and never reused.** `27` and `29` are retired by [P2-006](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-006); their files remain as retirement records so an older citation resolves to an explanation rather than a broken reference.
- **Numbering is allocation order, not execution order.** `00`–`50` were allocated when the obligations were derived and `51`–`53` were added later.


## [P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009) package boundaries

The 51 active packages keep their accepted scope; WP20 is future-only; WP27/29 remain retired. Package numbering and anchors are stable; titles and runtime/contract responsibilities reflect [P2-009](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-009). The `.90` substeps are the explicit repository and integration acceptance attached to inherited domain work; each package's closure task depends on every other task mapped to the package.


[Producer artifacts and real integration](../producer-artifacts-and-integration.md) defines each package's producer outputs, permitted substitutes and real replacement evidence.
