## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Current complete scope

The notebook core and cloud continuity are the product. Reference applications inform behaviour and correctness; their feature catalogues do not expand this scope.

| Capability family | Delivery |
|---|---|
| Document core | Rich text, document/folder hierarchy, stable blocks, block references, backlinks, outline, tags, search, attachments, undo, history and trash |
| Properties and views | Common scalar properties, saved list/table views, filtering, sorting and bounded queries |
| Cloud | Single-owner workspace, multi-device revisions/conflicts, attachment availability and recovery |
| AI | Selection actions and product tools executed through the Cloud AI service |
| Excluded | Edgeless/whiteboard, shapes/connectors/spatial workbench, frames/frame ordering, slides/presentations, spaced repetition/flashcards, DOCX import, formula/relation/rollup engines and collaboration |

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-sc-01"></a>SC-01 | Deliver the notebook scope above. AFFiNE and SiYuan are behaviour references; no external-product parity or phased presentation/whiteboard obligation remains. |
| <a id="rule-sc-02"></a>SC-02 | No empty implementation, reserved project, schema hook or acceptance gate is created for an excluded capability. |
| <a id="rule-sc-03"></a>SC-03 | Retired by [P2-006](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-006): Edgeless Canvas is not a current ArcNotes capability or separate product. |

### 1.2 Required foundations

| # | Hook |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ch-01"></a>CH-01 | Stable notebook/document/block identities, explicit revisions and unified reference semantics support edits and multi-device conflict handling. |
| <a id="rule-ch-02"></a>CH-02 | Retired by [P2-006](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-006): no required future Surface/Canvas block extension. |
| <a id="rule-ch-03"></a>CH-03 | Retired by [P2-006](../../decisions/phase-2-specification-decisions.md#rule-p2-006): no canvas positions, connectors, frames or spatial-layout storage. |
| <a id="rule-ch-04"></a>CH-04 | Typed scalar properties, bounded queries and saved views support notebook organisation. |
| <a id="rule-ch-05"></a>CH-05 | No speculative fields in core blocks for excluded product families. |
| <a id="rule-ch-06"></a>CH-06 | Supported block types use static/source-generated registration compatible with Native AOT. |
| <a id="rule-ch-07"></a>CH-07 | Stable IDs, base revisions, outbox/inbox and tombstones serve single-user multi-device sync; no CRDT, membership, shared cursors or future-collaboration reservation. |

---

## 2. Product principles

| # | Principle |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-pr-01"></a>PR-01 | **Document-first, not database-first.** A note is a document; the database capability grows over documents, not the reverse. |
| <a id="rule-pr-02"></a>PR-02 | **Cloud-backed with native editing.** A realm/workspace is required for notebook enrolment. Previously hydrated notes remain editable/searchable offline; pending edits survive crashes and are distinct from acknowledged Cloud versions. |
| <a id="rule-pr-03"></a>PR-03 | **Canonical Document ≠ Markdown file** ([I-190](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-190)). Markdown is a first-class **interchange** format, not the runtime authority. |
| <a id="rule-pr-04"></a>PR-04 | Basic data portability is provided by the Cloud export in §13; no proprietary encrypted local package is required. |
| <a id="rule-pr-05"></a>PR-05 | **ArcNotes is the long-term knowledge authority** (`§9` of the knowledge requirements). ArcChat references and retrieves; it never becomes a second knowledge store. |
| <a id="rule-pr-06"></a>PR-06 | ArcNotes provides bounded notebook properties and query views. It does not implement a spreadsheet, relational application builder or complete reference-product database engine. |

### 2.1 Three depths of use

ArcNotes must serve, in one product: quick capture and everyday notes; structured personal knowledge with links, properties and retrieval; and long professional documents with history, attachments and export.

---

## 3. Organisation model

```
Notebook
 └── Folder (hierarchical)
      └── Document
           └── Block (hierarchical)
```

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-or-01"></a>OR-01 | **Notebook = the top-level ArcNotes knowledge/document container.** |
| <a id="rule-or-02"></a>OR-02 | **Notebooks do not nest.** Hierarchy is provided by folders. |
| <a id="rule-or-03"></a>OR-03 | **Notebook ≠ ArcForges Workspace** ([I-460](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-460)). A workspace is the cloud tenancy boundary; a notebook is an ArcNotes container. |
| <a id="rule-or-04"></a>OR-04 | Every notebook belongs to one single-owner Cloud workspace. Device cache availability is a local policy, not a permanent local-only notebook ownership mode. |
| <a id="rule-or-05"></a>OR-05 | **The notebook is the default ArcNotes cloud sync scope** ([SY-01](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-sy-01)). |
| <a id="rule-or-06"></a>OR-06 | **Folder = hierarchical location organisation inside a notebook.** |
| <a id="rule-or-07"></a>OR-07 | **Documents do not nest inside documents.** Document hierarchy must not be used as a substitute for folders. |
| <a id="rule-or-08"></a>OR-08 | **`Folder ≠ Tag`** ([I-460](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-460)). Location and cross-cutting classification are separate. |

---

## 4. Document

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-dc-01"></a>DC-01 | **Document is the core authoritative object.** Quick notes, daily notes and long documents are **all documents**; `Note` is not a second data model ([I-461](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-461)). |
| <a id="rule-dc-02"></a>DC-02 | A document carries at minimum: stable `DocumentId`, title, ordered block content, typed properties, tags, system metadata, revisions, and its notebook and folder placement. |
| <a id="rule-dc-03"></a>DC-03 | **Title is an independent concept**, not merely the first heading block. |
| <a id="rule-dc-04"></a>DC-04 | **Quick Capture creates an ordinary document** in a defined default location (an Inbox notebook or equivalent). **No `QuickNote` entity exists.** |
| <a id="rule-dc-05"></a>DC-05 | **Daily Note is an ordinary document** created by a template or creation recipe. It is not a separate model. |
| <a id="rule-dc-06"></a>DC-06 | **`Document ≠ File`** ([I-460](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-460)). |

---

## 5. Block

**Document = an ordered block structure.**

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-bl-01"></a>BL-01 | Every block has a stable BlockId under editing, moves, indentation and reordering. References and multi-device revision reconciliation depend on this identity. |
| <a id="rule-bl-02"></a>BL-02 | **Blocks support hierarchy** (nesting), independent of document nesting. |
| <a id="rule-bl-03"></a>BL-03 | **`Block ≠ Markdown line`** ([I-460](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-460)). |
| <a id="rule-bl-04"></a>BL-04 | **V1 first-party block types**: paragraph, headings, bulleted list, numbered list, checklist item, quote, callout, code, divider, table, math, image, file/attachment, PDF, embed/reference, toggle/collapsible. |
| <a id="rule-bl-05"></a>BL-05 | **`ArcNotes.ChecklistItem ≠ ArcChat Agent Task`** ([I-464](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-464)). A checklist item is document content. It may later relate to an agent task explicitly; it is never silently one. |
| <a id="rule-bl-06"></a>BL-06 | **Arbitrary HTML or script blocks are not offered in V1.** Extensibility goes through the extension model, out of process, with declared capability (`§8` of the extension requirements). |
| <a id="rule-bl-07"></a>BL-07 | **Inline content** — bold, italic, code, links, mentions, footnote references — is modelled explicitly, not as embedded markup strings. V1 math is a block under [notes.math.v1](../../architecture/26-product-behavior-profiles.md#initial-math-profile--notesmathv1); legacy inline math preserves its source with an unsupported marker, without enabling inline-math authoring. |
| <a id="rule-bl-08"></a>BL-08 | Block types are registered **statically or by source generation** ([CH-06](#rule-ch-06)). |

---

## 6. Editor

**A rich block editor with Markdown-friendly interaction** — not a Markdown source editor.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ed-01"></a>ED-01 | Markdown keyboard syntax is supported as an **input convenience** (typing `#` produces a heading), never as the storage model. |
| <a id="rule-ed-02"></a>ED-02 | A **slash menu** inserts blocks and applies content actions. |
| <a id="rule-ed-03"></a>ED-03 | **The slash menu is not the command palette** ([CM-07](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-cm-07)). The palette runs product commands; the slash menu inserts and transforms content. |
| <a id="rule-ed-04"></a>ED-04 | Complete block operations: insert, delete, duplicate, move up/down, indent/outdent, convert type, split, merge, copy as, and multi-block operations. |
| <a id="rule-ed-05"></a>ED-05 | **Multi-block selection is a first-class capability**, with keyboard and mouse, and all block operations available across a selection. |
| <a id="rule-ed-06"></a>ED-06 | **Block drag and drop within a document is a move.** Cross-document and cross-application drops follow the shared semantics — Reference / Copy / Import — and are never silently destructive ([DD-01](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-dd-01)–[DD-03](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-dd-03)). |
| <a id="rule-ed-07"></a>ED-07 | **A Table block is a document table, not a relational database engine.** V1 does not turn it into one ([PR-06](#rule-pr-06)). |
| <a id="rule-ed-08"></a>ED-08 | An **Outline** view derives from headings. |

---

## 7. Properties, tags and views

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-pt-01"></a>PT-01 | **Typed properties are distinct from tables** ([I-462](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-462)). Properties describe the document; a table is content inside it. |
| <a id="rule-pt-02"></a>PT-02 | Required property types: text, number, date/date-time, checkbox, single-select, multi-select and URL. Person/member fields, computed formulas, relationship properties and rollups are excluded. |
| <a id="rule-pt-03"></a>PT-03 | **System properties and user properties are separated.** Created time, modified time, author and revision are system-owned and not user-editable as arbitrary fields. |
| <a id="rule-pt-04"></a>PT-04 | **Properties must not make ordinary notes heavy.** A plain note has no mandatory property ceremony. |
| <a id="rule-pt-05"></a>PT-05 | **`Property ≠ document content`** ([I-462](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-462)). |
| <a id="rule-pt-06"></a>PT-06 | **Tag = cross-cutting classification.** A tag carries no hierarchical location ([OR-08](#rule-or-08)). |
| <a id="rule-pt-07"></a>PT-07 | **Deleting a tag never deletes documents** ([I-462](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-462)); it removes a classification. |
| <a id="rule-pt-08"></a>PT-08 | Tag scope follows data-ownership scope, not a global namespace across unrelated notebooks. |
| <a id="rule-pt-09"></a>PT-09 | **Saved View = a saved query plus sort, filter and view configuration.** |
| <a id="rule-pt-10"></a>PT-10 | **A saved view owns nothing** ([I-462](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-462)). Deleting a view deletes the view definition only. |
| <a id="rule-pt-11"></a>PT-11 | **V1 delivers saved list and table views.** A view selects authorised documents in a notebook, projects chosen properties and applies bounded typed filters and stable sorting. Calendar, board, gallery and spatial layouts are not required. |
| <a id="rule-pt-12"></a>PT-12 | **Favorites and Recent are user-level presentation state**, and Recent is derived. Neither is content. |
| <a id="rule-pt-13"></a>PT-13 | Property definitions and options have stable IDs. Renaming preserves existing values and view bindings; changing type requires validation and a loss preview. Incompatible values are preserved or the change is refused, never silently discarded. |
| <a id="rule-pt-14"></a>PT-14 | Missing value differs from empty string, false and zero. Date/time zone, number comparison, case sensitivity, null ordering and an identity tie-breaker are declared so Cloud and native cached views agree. |
| <a id="rule-pt-15"></a>PT-15 | View edits change the owning document property through the ordinary revision/conflict path. Deleting a view never deletes source documents. Unsupported query operators and excessive query complexity fail explicitly. |

---

<a id="notes-scalar-query-profile"></a>
### 7.1 Scalar values and query profile

**`notes.scalar.v1`** is the required comparison and saved-view profile. It governs native cached queries and the Notes filter on Cloud search. Every ID comparison uses the [canonical ID-byte order](../../architecture/data-model/00-data-model-overview.md#canonical-id-order). Saved list/table views select authorized, nontrashed documents in one notebook. Cloud search outside a saved view keeps its separately declared retrieval/ranking behavior. A local result explicitly states its hydrated-cache scope and pending state; it never implies complete Cloud coverage.

| Kind | Value and comparison | Value operators |
|---|---|---|
| `text`, `url` | Valid Unicode; ordinal Unicode scalar comparison, case-sensitive; no normalization, trimming, culture collation or URL fetch. Empty string is present | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in`, `contains/startsWith/endsWith` |
| `number` | Exact decimal string, at most 28 significant digits and scale 0–9. Canonical form: no exponent, plus, leading zeroes, trailing fractional zeroes or negative zero; reject excess precision, never round on write/query | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in` |
| `date` | Valid Gregorian `YYYY-MM-DD`, years 0001–9999; compare calendar dates, no timezone | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in` |
| `dateTime` | Explicit UTC or numeric offset required; no leap seconds; up to seven fractional digits; canonical storage is UTC with seven digits. Compare instants; entered offset may be retained only for display | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in` |
| `checkbox` | Boolean, false before true | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in` |
| `select` | Existing stable option ID, compared by canonical ID bytes; changing a label never changes equality/order | `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/in` |
| `multiSelect` | Duplicate-free set of at most 100 existing option IDs, serialized in ID-byte order; equality is set equality | `eq/ne`, `hasAny/hasAll` |

Every kind also supports `isMissing` and `isPresent`. Missing means no property value row. A null write removes the row; a null filter literal is invalid. Empty string, empty set, false and zero are present. Every value predicate, **including `ne`**, is false for missing values. Boolean `not` negates its child's full result: `not(eq(...))` therefore includes missing, deliberately unlike `ne`. `in`, `hasAny` and `hasAll` accept 1–100 typed literals. Text operations use the same case-sensitive scalar sequence as equality; no regex or evaluator is implied.

**Predicate wire literals.** `ScalarPredicate.operands` is empty for `isMissing`/`isPresent`, contains one scalar of the declared property kind for ordinary comparisons/text operators, and contains 1–100 scalars of that same kind for `in`. For a `multiSelect` property, `eq`/`ne` takes one `ScalarValue.multiSelect` set; `hasAny`/`hasAll` instead takes 1–100 `ScalarValue.select` option IDs, representing elements to test. Membership operand order does not affect the result and repeated membership operands have no additional meaning; the duplicate-free canonical ordering requirement applies to the stored `multiSelect` set, not to a predicate's operand list. Definition/option existence and permission checks remain owner responsibilities.

Definition config carries `profile`, declared type, and options (at most 1000 stable IDs); optional number scale restricts the v1 maximum and defaults to 9. Other comparison modes are not offered in v1. Unknown additive metadata is preserved but cannot activate an operator. A literal or value of the wrong type, an unknown/deleted definition or option, or an unsupported operator returns `validation.invalid_request` before evaluation. Authorization is checked before revealing identifier validity. No implicit string/number/boolean conversion occurs.

**Filter and projection bounds.** The typed AST is `all`/`any` (1–32 children), unary `not`, or a typed property predicate. An absent or null filter field means match-all; null predicate literals remain invalid. Maximum depth is 8 including the root and leaf, total nodes 128, encoded query 64 KiB, string literal 4096 Unicode scalars, sort keys 8 and projected property IDs 64. Complexity overflow returns `validation.ast_bounds_exceeded`; syntax/type error returns invalid-request; unknown profile returns `validation.unsupported_version`. No failing predicate is silently dropped or reinterpreted. Existing tag/link/text search selectors remain typed separate query fields; they cannot smuggle an expression into a property predicate.

**Ordering.** Apply sort keys in declared order using the table's comparison. Missing sorts last for both ascending and descending order. Multi-select sorting compares the sorted ID arrays lexicographically, with a shorter equal prefix first. Append DocumentId ascending by canonical ID bytes as the final tie-break regardless of requested directions. Default order is DocumentId ascending. Page size defaults to 100, maximum 500; larger sizes clamp with the catalogue's warning, nonpositive sizes are invalid.

**Definition changes.** Rename preserves identity, values and view bindings. `semanticRev` changes for type/option membership/comparison-affecting config, not label-only changes; the normal definition `rev` still changes for every mutation. A v1 type change has an impact/loss preview and is refused while any value or saved-view predicate, sort or projection references the definition. Users may explicitly remove dependencies through normal revisioned commands and then change it; there is no implicit conversion. Removing a referenced option is likewise refused. Trashing a definition leaves dependent views visibly invalid until explicitly repaired, never broadened. Saved views store profile, own revision and referenced semantic revisions. Unknown historical profiles remain readable/preservable but cannot execute or be rewritten by guessing a newer profile; migration must explicitly validate the view and write a new revision.

**Stable pages or explicit restart.** A signed opaque cursor expires after 15 minutes and binds principal/realm/workspace/notebook, profile, query fingerprint, saved-view revision, referenced semantic revisions, last composite sort key/DocumentId and dataset token. The dataset token identifies the authorized Notes source set at an acknowledged revision; locally it additionally binds hydration and pending-local generations. It changes on relevant membership/value/trash/authorization changes, including a newly matching document. At each page, reauthorize, validate the bindings and read one consistent dataset. A changed dataset/view/semantic revision returns `conflict.revision_mismatch` and a restart instruction, without a partial success page. Expired cursor/unsupported profile returns unsupported-version; forged scope or changed query is refused. Thus concurrent mutation cannot silently duplicate or omit a row across successful pages. This specializes the [shared cursor rules](../../architecture/contracts/00-operation-catalogue.md#6-cursors-and-pagination); physical indexes, token construction and storage snapshots remain internal choices.

**Acceptance vectors.** For increasing document IDs D1–D4 with text values missing, empty, `A`, `a`, ascending text order is D2,D3,D4,D1 and `ne("A")` returns D2,D4. Numeric 0,2,10 sorts numerically; checkbox false is present; `2026-01-01T01:00:00+01:00` equals `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Equal sort keys use ascending IDs even for descending keys. Compare complete page concatenation between Cloud and a fully hydrated, acknowledged local set with identical authorization/revisions. Verify label rename stability, type-change refusal, option removal, invalid definition, each AST bound and a restart after concurrent value/insertion/trash changes. Partial hydration is reported as partial and is not used to assert equality to the complete Cloud set.

## 8. Links and references

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-lk-01"></a>LK-01 | **Internal links target a stable document identity**, never a title or a path. |
| <a id="rule-lk-02"></a>LK-02 | **Renaming a document never breaks a link** ([SY-11](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-sy-11)). |
| <a id="rule-lk-03"></a>LK-03 | **Link display supports an alias**: target identity and display text are separate. |
| <a id="rule-lk-04"></a>LK-04 | **Block links** target a stable `BlockId`. |
| <a id="rule-lk-05"></a>LK-05 | **Backlinks are a derived relationship** from the link index. **They are never written into the document body** ([I-134](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-134)). |
| <a id="rule-lk-06"></a>LK-06 | **A broken link has an explicit state** — target deleted, target unavailable, target in an unsynced notebook — and is never silently rendered as plain text. |
| <a id="rule-lk-07"></a>LK-07 | **Reference embed renders another document or block as a reference view.** |
| <a id="rule-lk-08"></a>LK-08 | **Editing authority for embedded content stays with the original object** ([WA-01](../13-data-formats-and-portability.md#rule-wa-01)). An embed is never a second writable block. |
| <a id="rule-lk-09"></a>LK-09 | A **Backlinks panel** lists incoming references with context. |

---

## 9. Attachments

Two categories, permanently separate ([I-193](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-193)):

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Managed Attachment** | Added into ArcNotes; ArcNotes owns identity, lifecycle, hash, sync and backup |
| **External Attachment Reference** | Left where the user put it; ArcNotes references and does not own it |

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-at-01"></a>AT-01 | Dragging an ordinary small file into a document creates a **managed attachment** by default. |
| <a id="rule-at-02"></a>AT-02 | A large file, or one obviously belonging to an external library, prompts for the choice rather than silently copying ([AS-03](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-as-03)). |
| <a id="rule-at-03"></a>AT-03 | **An attachment is never base64-embedded into document content** ([I-463](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-463)). |
| <a id="rule-at-04"></a>AT-04 | **An image block references an attachment**; image editing is not part of ArcNotes. |
| <a id="rule-at-05"></a>AT-05 | **PDF is supported as a first-class attachment** with in-product viewing, page-anchored annotation targets and citation anchors. |
| <a id="rule-at-06"></a>AT-06 | **Extracted PDF text is derived data** ([IP-09](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-ip-09)), rebuildable, and never canonical. |
| <a id="rule-at-07"></a>AT-07 | **Attachment availability is an explicit state**: present locally, cloud-only, downloading, missing external, or unavailable — with recovery affordances ([AS-04](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-as-04)). |

---

## 10. Search and knowledge

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-sr-01"></a>SR-01 | Search is a first-class ArcNotes capability, in three scopes: **within the current document**, **within the current notebook**, **across hydrated notebooks** (with an explicit broader Cloud search scope). |
| <a id="rule-sr-02"></a>SR-02 | **Basic search never requires AI** ([IX-03](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-ix-03)). Full-text and metadata search work with no model present. |
| <a id="rule-sr-03"></a>SR-03 | Search filters cover notebook, folder, tag, property, date range, block type and attachment presence. |
| <a id="rule-sr-04"></a>SR-04 | **A search result locates the specific block** wherever possible, so opening lands the user at the match. |
| <a id="rule-sr-05"></a>SR-05 | **Semantic search is an enhancement, never a replacement** ([IX-04](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-ix-04)). With the semantic index unavailable, ordinary search still works. |
| <a id="rule-sr-06"></a>SR-06 | Semantic retrieval and model-based embedding run only in Cloud and require service entitlement and explicit knowledge eligibility. Native full-text/metadata search over hydrated content remains available without AI. |
| <a id="rule-sr-07"></a>SR-07 | The **knowledge status of a notebook is visible**: indexed, partially indexed, not indexed, excluded, stale. |
| <a id="rule-sr-08"></a>SR-08 | **Knowledge is a projection, never a second copy** ([I-134](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-134)). Documents and attachments are the source. |
| <a id="rule-sr-09"></a>SR-09 | **Knowledge participation is per notebook with per-document override** ([KS-06](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-ks-06)). |
| <a id="rule-sr-10"></a>SR-10 | **Knowledge eligibility is separate from ordinary search permission** ([I-253](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-253)). |
| <a id="rule-sr-11"></a>SR-11 | **Cloud knowledge is never automatically enabled** by enabling sync ([I-182](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-182), [PL-06](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-pl-06)). |

---

## 11. AI in ArcNotes

Three layers, with a firm boundary at the third:

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| **1 — Editor AI actions** | Selection-scoped actions: summarise, rewrite, translate, extract, continue, fix, explain |
| **2 — Ask assistant** | Opens the embedded assistant with a bounded ArcNotes context reference and receives an answer or owned artifact |
| **3 — Agent-driven ArcNotes capabilities** | The Cloud agent invokes authorized ArcNotes capabilities under the full permission model |

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ai-01"></a>AI-01 | Selection AI and the embedded assistant call Cloud directly through Platform APIs. Authenticated workspace, active term, minimal authorized context and capacity are required; no local model or separate assistant process. |
| <a id="rule-ai-02"></a>AI-02 | ArcNotes has no agent loop. Cloud owns the sole Harness; the embedded assistant and own-application device bridge provide task interaction and local authorization. |
| <a id="rule-ai-03"></a>AI-03 | **"Ask ArcChat" passes a context reference, never a blanket copy** ([CX-03](arcchat.md#rule-cx-03)). |
| <a id="rule-ai-04"></a>AI-04 | **Clicking "Ask ArcChat" must never upload an entire notebook.** The minimum necessary context is passed ([AS-08](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-as-08)). |
| <a id="rule-ai-05"></a>AI-05 | **Every AI modification carries provenance** ([SY-21](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-sy-21)): actor is the agent, with task, capability and approval reference. |
| <a id="rule-ai-06"></a>AI-06 | **A checkpoint is created before any large-scale agent modification** ([CK-02](../05-ai-and-agent-execution.md#rule-ck-02)), labelled meaningfully ("before agent edit"). |
| <a id="rule-ai-07"></a>AI-07 | **A complex AI edit supports Review Changes** — a diff the user accepts or rejects — before it is committed. |
| <a id="rule-ai-08"></a>AI-08 | **A small AI insertion does not require a full diff interface**; it is an ordinary undoable edit. |

### 11.1 Capabilities exposed to ArcChat

ArcNotes contributes **context providers**, **agent capabilities**, **artifact handlers**, **actions**, **suggested tasks** and **deep link targets** ([AP-06](arcchat.md#rule-ap-06) in the ArcChat requirements). Capability families include: query and search; read document and block; create document; insert, update and restructure blocks; manage properties and tags; manage links; manage attachments; create checkpoints; export; and delete.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-cp-01"></a>CP-01 | **Deletion capabilities exist and are high-risk**, carrying elevated risk level, explicit approval and a checkpoint (`R2`–`R4` per operation scale). |
| <a id="rule-cp-02"></a>CP-02 | **ArcNotes is an artifact handler**: a task producing a report creates an **ArcNotes Document owned by ArcNotes**, and ArcChat receives an `ArtifactRef` ([AR-01](arcchat.md#rule-ar-01)). |
| <a id="rule-cp-03"></a>CP-03 | Cross-product report import is future-only. Current imports use the explicitly supported file formats and create ArcNotes-owned content with retained provenance; they do not create shared writable objects. |
| <a id="rule-cp-04"></a>CP-04 | Current context/resource references resolve inside ArcNotes or its admitted external sources. ArcScope references are future-only examples. |

## 12. History, recovery and deletion

Four separate levels ([I-201](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-201)–[I-205](../01-normative-glossary-and-invariants.md#rule-i-205)):

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Undo / Redo** | In-session, semantic-command based |
| **Document Revision History** | Durable committed history |
| **Checkpoint** | A named recovery landmark |
| **Trash** | Deleted items pending purge |

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-hr-01"></a>HR-01 | **History UI displays the actor** — user, or agent with its task — so "why did this change?" is answerable. |
| <a id="rule-hr-02"></a>HR-02 | **Restoring an earlier state does not delete subsequent history.** Restore creates a new revision. |
| <a id="rule-hr-03"></a>HR-03 | Cloud history is the acknowledged multi-device record. Local undo, recovery journal and unacknowledged edit checkpoints protect working changes; they do not form a second independently authoritative notebook history. |
| <a id="rule-hr-04"></a>HR-04 | **Restoring from trash preserves the `DocumentId`** ([DE-03](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-de-03)). |
| <a id="rule-hr-05"></a>HR-05 | **Deleting a folder moves the folder and its descendants to trash.** |
| <a id="rule-hr-06"></a>HR-06 | **Deleting a tag has entirely different semantics**: documents are untouched ([PT-07](#rule-pt-07)). |
| <a id="rule-hr-07"></a>HR-07 | **Deleting a saved view deletes the view definition only** ([PT-10](#rule-pt-10)). |
| <a id="rule-hr-08"></a>HR-08 | Crash recovery follows [`../13-data-formats-and-portability.md`](../13-data-formats-and-portability.md) §9: everything reported saved survives; a damaged derived index never produces "corrupt". |

---

## 13. Import and export

### 13.1 Import

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-im-01"></a>IM-01 | Import remains a non-destructive way to move existing notes into a Cloud notebook. |
| <a id="rule-im-02"></a>IM-02 | Required formats are plain text and Markdown files/folders with local attachments and relative links, including an Obsidian-style folder/vault layout. DOCX, Notion-specific, HTML and proprietary full-fidelity package importers are not required. |
| <a id="rule-im-03"></a>IM-03 | Sources are never modified or deleted. Input size, attachment access and path traversal are validated before processing. |
| <a id="rule-im-04"></a>IM-04 | Preserve representable hierarchy, links, attachments, tags and metadata. Unsupported constructs are retained as safe text or reported; no silent loss or execution of embedded content. |
| <a id="rule-im-05"></a>IM-05 | Produce an import report: created, skipped, approximated, unresolved references and rejected files, with actionable reasons. |
| <a id="rule-im-06"></a>IM-06 | Import batches have stable origins and idempotency keys. Retrying the same batch cannot duplicate documents; deliberately importing again offers a preview before updates/copies. |
| <a id="rule-im-07"></a>IM-07 | No live bidirectional folder mirror, linked-vault mode or standalone local notebook is required. Staged import work remains recoverable until Cloud commit or explicit cancellation. |

### 13.2 Export

The required exit path is a **Cloud-generated notebook/account download**, with Markdown documents, attachments, a machine-readable metadata/link manifest and a fidelity report. It preserves access to user-created data without promising lossless interchange for every editor representation.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ep-01"></a>EP-01 | Users select the notebooks/documents to export. Export validates owner/workspace access and reports missing or unavailable attachments; it never silently claims a complete result. |
| <a id="rule-ep-02"></a>EP-02 | Export is available for retained data after a paid term ends. The downloadable artifact has a bounded lifetime and authorised access. Cancellation or expiry of that artifact does not delete source notes. |
| <a id="rule-ep-03"></a>EP-03 | Snapshot the acknowledged source revisions. Pending device-only edits are not falsely included; the UI explains that they must synchronise first or be recovered locally. |
| <a id="rule-ep-04"></a>EP-04 | Custom local encrypted export, native portable packages, HTML/PDF/DOCX export pipelines and bit-for-bit native archive round-trips are not required. Ordinary clipboard/attachment saving and crash recovery are not removed. |

The earlier export identifiers remain binding within this narrower Cloud exit path:

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-ex-01"></a>EX-01 | Supported scalar properties, links and hierarchy that Markdown cannot represent use documented metadata/sidecars. Unsupported blocks/formatting receive explicit approximations or loss entries; no excluded canvas/presentation support is inferred. |
| <a id="rule-ex-02"></a>EX-02 | External attachments are excluded by default. Only explicitly selected and authorized available bytes may be collected; device-only references are listed as unavailable until separately uploaded. |
| <a id="rule-ex-03"></a>EX-03 | Every export declares its semantic round-trip/fidelity level. Markdown plus metadata is not advertised as a lossless native execution/archive format. |

### 13.3 Portability acceptance

Import a Markdown folder with nested links and attachments; retry without duplication; synchronise; export the selected notebook from Cloud; verify content, attachment hashes, link mapping and the declared loss report. Interrupt export and retry without changing source state. No DOCX importer or excluded package UI is reachable.

---

## 14. Cloud behaviour

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-cl-01"></a>CL-01 | **ArcNotes' cloud data capabilities do not depend on ArcChat** (**[D-010](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-010)**). |
| <a id="rule-cl-02"></a>CL-02 | Notebook creation/enrolment explicitly identifies the Cloud workspace. Subsequent notebook edits synchronise automatically under that enrolment; turning off device hydration does not change Cloud ownership. |
| <a id="rule-cl-03"></a>CL-03 | Notebook onboarding explains that new documents and managed attachments will be stored in Cloud. Sign-in alone never uploads unrelated local files, existing external libraries or device folders. |
| <a id="rule-cl-04"></a>CL-04 | Each device holds a selected, revision-labelled working cache, not a mandatory complete replica. Pending writes are durable and cannot be evicted before acknowledgement or explicit user discard. |
| <a id="rule-cl-05"></a>CL-05 | Cloud unavailability preserves editing and keyword search for hydrated content. Pending changes are visibly unsynchronised; unavailable content, AI and Cloud operations show specific unavailable states. |
| <a id="rule-cl-06"></a>CL-06 | **Storage full** pauses cloud writes only; local editing and saving continue ([ST-06](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-st-06)). |
| <a id="rule-cl-07"></a>CL-07 | **A new device fetches metadata and small content first**; attachments hydrate per policy ([AS-08](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-as-08)). |
| <a id="rule-cl-08"></a>CL-08 | **Attachment availability policy is user-controlled** per notebook ([AS-07](../03-cloud-services-and-sync.md#rule-as-07)). |
| <a id="rule-cl-09"></a>CL-09 | **Cloud search covers only synced and authorised content**, and content is never uploaded merely to make cloud search work ([SR-08](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-sr-08) in the knowledge requirements). |

---

## 15. Window and session behaviour

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-wn-01"></a>WN-01 | Multi-window and split view are supported ([WN-02](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-wn-02)). |
| <a id="rule-wn-02"></a>WN-02 | **The same document open in several windows of one process shares one logical document session and one write authority** ([WN-04](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-wn-04)). |
| <a id="rule-wn-03"></a>WN-03 | **Window physical coordinates are device-local** ([WN-05](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-wn-05)); a named layout is the syncable concept ([LY-03](../09-shared-desktop-experience.md#rule-ly-03)). |
| <a id="rule-wn-04"></a>WN-04 | Document tabs, breadcrumb and an inspector panel (properties, backlinks, outline, history, attachments) are provided. |
| <a id="rule-wn-05"></a>WN-05 | **Breadcrumb shows the ArcNotes location** — notebook and folder — not a cloud workspace path. |

---

## 16. First run

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-fr-01"></a>FR-01 | First notebook use signs into a realm and selects its workspace. Returning users open authorized cached content during outages. Sign-out blocks normal workspace views; the explicit local pending-work recovery path in identity [DL-01](../02-identity-account-and-workspace.md#rule-dl-01) is a narrow exception, not account-free notebook creation or AI. |
| <a id="rule-fr-02"></a>FR-02 | After account/workspace setup, first value is creating a note and typing immediately; shell startup never waits for background hydration/indexing. |
| <a id="rule-fr-03"></a>FR-03 | AI entitlement, provider availability and model configuration never block ordinary editing of available content. |
| <a id="rule-fr-04"></a>FR-04 | ArcNotes carries its own assistant packages and direct Cloud client. Its editing and selection AI do not depend on another product or coordinator. |
| <a id="rule-fr-05"></a>FR-05 | Startup meets the budget in [`../12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md`](../12-quality-and-compatibility-contract.md) §5, with no cloud dependency in the startup path. |

---

## 17. Non-goals

ArcNotes is **not**: a Notion clone or an application builder; a spreadsheet; a project-management suite; an image editor; a collaborative editor; a Markdown folder mirror; or a second agent platform.

**A knowledge graph, if offered, is a derived view of the link graph** — never a separate authoritative store ([IX-06](../06-knowledge-search-and-retrieval.md#rule-ix-06)).

**A web clipper**, if offered later, is an import path producing ordinary ArcNotes documents, not a live external mirror.

**Checklist items may relate to agent tasks later, explicitly** ([BL-05](#rule-bl-05)); they never become tasks implicitly.

---

## 18. Domain model

```
Notebook · Folder · Document · Block · BlockType · InlineContent
DocumentProperty · PropertyDefinition · Tag · DocumentTag
DocumentLink · BlockLink · ReferenceEmbed
Attachment · ManagedAttachment · ExternalAttachmentReference
DocumentTemplate · SavedView
DocumentRevision · DocumentCheckpoint · DocumentTrashEntry
DocumentSession
SearchResult · SearchScope · KnowledgeEligibility · IndexState
ImportJob · ImportOrigin · ExportJob
ArcNotesArtifactReference
```

The domain contains only the accepted notebook and property-view concepts. No canvas, presentation, flashcard or collaboration domain reservations are required.

---

## 19. V1 scope

| Area | V1 |
|---|---|
| **Content** | Notebook, folder, document, block editor, rich text, lists and checklists, code, table, math, image/file/PDF |
| **Organisation** | Tags, properties, favorites, recent, internal links, backlinks, outline |
| **Retrieval** | Full-text search, metadata filters, basic saved views |
| **Reliability** | Autosave, undo/redo, history, checkpoint, trash, crash recovery |
| **Portability** | Markdown/text and folder/vault import; Cloud Markdown/attachment/metadata export |
| **AI** | Selection AI actions, Ask ArcChat, ArcChat context and capabilities, agent provenance and checkpoints |
| **Cloud** | Explicit notebook sync, managed attachment sync, cloud status, version and recovery integration |

Advanced importers and excluded workbenches are outside the current delivery baseline.

---

## 20. Reference relationship

**AFFiNE and SiYuan are ArcNotes references** (**[D-012](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-012)**) — sources of features, behaviour, tests and migration evidence, **never architecture authorities or parity commitments**.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| <a id="rule-rf-01"></a>RF-01 | Maintain an ArcNotes Reference Coverage Matrix for AFFiNE and SiYuan, mapping accepted notebook behaviour to target data/UI/contracts and acceptance evidence. Classify excluded whiteboard, presentation, collaboration, flashcard and advanced database behaviour as Drop or Reference Only; no implementation gate remains for them. |
| <a id="rule-rf-02"></a>RF-02 | **Reuse is licence-gated and provenance-gated** (**[D-013](../../decisions/phase-1-foundation-decisions.md#rule-d-013)**). File-level SPDX evidence against the local repository baseline is required before any copy, translation or port — the **[F-013](../../assurance/open-gates-register.md#rule-f-013)** gate. AGPL-identified material is behavioural reference only, implemented independently. |
| <a id="rule-rf-03"></a>RF-03 | Reference material informs feature depth; **the target runtime architecture is ArcForges' own** — C#, Avalonia, Native AOT, the ArcForges domain and persistence model. |

---

## 21. Acceptance scenarios

**Notebook core** — sign into a workspace, create a notebook/folder/document, edit rich blocks, save and acknowledge Cloud; reopen on another device; links, ordering, tags and metadata agree.

**Native resilience** — hydrate a notebook, disconnect, edit and search it; restart after a durable local save; pending edits survive and remain visibly unsynchronised. Reconnect against a changed base revision: both versions survive as an explicit conflict. Never call pending edits Cloud-saved.

**Block identity and references** — move/rename/edit without breaking document or block links; backlinks are derived; deleted or unavailable targets have explicit states.

**Properties/views** — list and table views share the same source documents; typed filtering/sorting agrees between Cloud and hydrated cache; rename a property without losing values; reject a lossy type change without confirmation; deleting a view leaves documents intact.

**Attachments** — managed uploads preserve bytes and references, large/external files require a clear choice, hydration loss is recoverable, and an unavailable attachment does not masquerade as downloaded.

**AI** — selection AI works through Cloud without the owning desktop application; no service term means no AI even with credits; no BYOK/model download UI exists; context is minimal; bulk edits require review and checkpoints.

**History/trash** — restore creates a new revision; trash restore preserves identity; deleting tags/views deletes no notes; deleting a folder has an explicit descendant scope.

**Portability** — §13.3 passes, including expired-subscription export of retained data and explicit handling of device-only pending edits.

**Scope enforcement** — no whiteboard, frames/slides, presentation navigation, spaced repetition, DOCX importer, formula/relation/rollup engine, E2EE or collaboration-only schema/acceptance obligation remains.
